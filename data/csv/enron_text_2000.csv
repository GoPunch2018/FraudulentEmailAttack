Subject:	RE: ComEd Transmission Rate Increase

Janine:

Can you make sure that this increase will really only impact unbundled customers.  Since transmission prices are regulated by FERC I would think that all customers, bundled or unbundled, would be subject to any increase.

Also, can you give a time when FERC is due to rule on this issue and how long it will be, if ComEd's proposed impact passes, before transmission rates might be affected.

I would also like to know how ComEd is justifying this increase and what Enron's counter position and arguments are.

Thanks,

Guy

Subject:	ComEd Transmission Rate Increase

ComEd has filed to increase its revenue requirements from $170 mil. to $340 which will have an adverse impact on EES's book of business.  From an EPMI standpoint, they are somewhat indifferent to the increase as long as all entities are treated the same and pay the same price.  

Guy Sharfman is going to analyse the impact on our books to determine our business interest.
Donna Fulton is going to check into the time frame for the proceeding at FERC.  We have already filed an intervention.

The problem in Illinois is that we may face the same problem on transmission that we face with distribution where unbundled customers could pay more for these services than bundled customers.  Thus, in addition to being concerned about our current book, this could adversely affect our ability to attract customers with our new product.  While we do not take on the transmission risk, we still would not be competitive if our transmission rate is higher than what a bundled customer faces. 

Will keep you posted to discuss decisions and strategy once the fact gathering is completed.

10,"John:

Claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composed 
jackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups and 
semis. He did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from a 
simpler index price calculation by taking the straight average. 

The results show a good R-square between the general index and individual 
jackup categories - on the range of 0.7 - 0.8. Only one category displayed a 
poor R-square - about 0.3. For semis of 4tht and 5th generation, however, we 
noticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - R-squares about 0.2 - 0.3. 
You may verify each regression by changing the choice cell (AX2 on Analysis). 

Claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages, 
12 month swaps on gas / crude, and rigs utilization explains the daily rates. 
We will forward the results as soon as we finish. 



Please call me or Claudio if you have questions.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

18,"Our source reports the following regarding  today's developments. In sum, due to the governor's sudden panic and  resultant willingness to negotiate, all parties are in a wait-and-see mode that  makes it unclear whether or not there will be an involuntary bankruptcy filing  early next week.  Our consensus view is that bankruptcy is still the most likely outcome, but the timing is subject to the ups and downs of these negotiations over the weekend.  Creditors, especially the small IPPs are close to the end on forbearance and highly frustrated with the erratic nature of the negotiations.

The events given in this report are  chronological:
 
- The original plan proposed by Governor Davis to  the utilities this morning contained the following points:

The parent companies of the utilities would have  to return to their subsidiaries $1.5 billion.  This money was originally  tranferred to the parent companies ostensibly so that the parents could use it  to pay taxes.  However, as was revealed in the audit, this money was in  excess of what was needed for taxes in reality.
The state would purchase the transmission assets  for $3.5 billion.
It was proposed that the utilities would issue  bonds to pay for the utilities' undercollection.  These bonds would be  secured against a ""distribution charge"" added to power bills.  This money  would be collected by DWR and transferred to the utilities, thereby involving  the state, but with less than a ""full faith and credit""  commitment.

- In contradiction to preliminary reports that  appeared in the press, this plan was rejected by the utilities.  One reason  for this rejection was the low price on the transmission assets.
 
- While the bondholders pressed for further  negotiations at this point in order to see if a deal could be reached; this is  because the bondholders are less impaired than the generators. The generators,  however, demanded that they be paid the money they are owed and threatened to  move quickly toward an involuntary bankrtupcy filing.
 
- Local sources report that Governor Davis  ""panicked"" at this point.  He then offered to purchase the transmission  assets for $6 billion (almost twice the earlier offer) and pay the generators'  undercollection (which amounts to $9 to $12 billion).  Reportedly, the  suggested term of the bonds that would be used to pay for this bail-out was 15  years, which would nearly double the actual cost of the bail-out.  This  plan would be put forward as a emergency legislative bill.
 
- At this point, consumer advocate Harvey  Rosenfield entered into negotiations with the state treasurer's office.  Rosenfield threatened that if the governor managed to pass this plan, he would start a  referendum to counter it.  Rosenfield would have up to 90 days after the  emergency bill was passed to put his referendum in place.  Knowledgeable  sources advise that it would be ""very difficult"" for the bonds in the plan to be  issued in less than 90 days; therefore, Rosenfield poses a credible  threat.
 
- In subsequent negotiations, Governor Davis has  offered to purchase the transmission assets for a price of at least $6 billion,  but possibly as high as $12 billion.
 
- Senator President Pro Tem John Burton is 'very  upset' with the governor for giving in on his negotiations so  easily.
 
- Mike Florio, another consumer advocate, contacted  Gov. Davis and said that the idea of negotiating a bail-out, as it  appeared Davis intended to do, was ""ridiculous.""  Florio and the other  consumer advocates threatened to ally themselves with Rosenfield and support the  referendum if Davis pursued such a course of action.  The consumer  advocates strongly feel that the generators have to ""take a hair cut"" as part of  the solution, as well.
 
- The governor will announce later this afternoon a  ""framework"" solution identical to that we have reported previously - a  state purchase of transmission assets and an issuance of bonds by the utilities,  but with state support through the DWR.  However, the state government has  yet to reach consensus on the numbers in this framework, and it remains unclear  whether the framework will be acceptable to all parties.
 
- With this announcement, the bondholders  may refrain from an involuntary filing in order to see what the terms of the  final agreement will be.  The generators, while more inclined to file  themselves, may feel that they have put enough pressure on the governor that it  may be worthwhile to wait and see, as well.  They are interested not only  in the terms of the agreement (and particularly the amount paid for the  undercollect), but also in the terms of the long-term power contracts that the  state must negotiate.  For example, if the state is willing to purchase  power at high prices in order to placate the generators, they would be very  likely to go along with the plan.

Transportation Services area.  Jeanette Trinidad of the area said ANR told
her when they tried to confirm the gas with Border @ Will County the lesser

23,"Mike,
As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art
Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I
would like to accomplish the following:

1) Discuss our Vision for the collection
2) Introduce Ned and Barry
3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings
4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable
5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the
decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision
and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The
latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but we
definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.
Questions right now for you:
1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?
2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should
we postpone?  Barry is a ""maybe"".  Remember they are there to help us shape
a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any
purchasing ""mistakes"".
3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss it?
Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list
of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so
that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud
and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.
Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are
considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to
discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed a
call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to
meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like
to propose a ""water piece"" for the circular drive.  You will recall that
Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very
well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow ""up"" and
wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked
his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in
Houston on their next trip.
Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging
in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

24,"Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

The following employees were tested:  John Shelk, Pat Shortridge, Chris Long, Steve Burns, Allison Hamilton, Larry Decker, Carolyn Cooney, Carin Nersesian, and myself.

The deal 226556 with volume of 4991 was billed and paid separately.  Volume 
was supposed to be 5000  (B&B still wants the 9 difference).  I just talked 
to John Singer and he is checking with B&B and with  National Fuel Gas for 
some paper.  He also indicated that this citygate gas was nommed into CES's 
pool.  If so, someone should be billing CES for it .


WRP










Victor and Robert, 
Please let us know if you can be of any help on this one.  The only deal with 
volumes that I see for Beldan and Blake is deal 226556 and it appears to have 
been netted with a CES deal 235398, in which case there would be nothing in 
navigator.  The deal that I believe Wade is referring to is 345224, but it is 
showing a zero volume in unify.  

Terry, I see several deals out there for Beldan and Blake all at NYSEG but 
with different prices.  The only one with volume is 226556 for a total volume 
of 4991.  Is  possible that all the volume may have been put on the one deal 
and should have been spread amongst the several deals?

Thanks!

Kathy

 Volume Management (Angel Fuller), has been unable to locate any volumes for 
Belden & Blake for May-00 NFGD PA (National Fuel Gas) gas under Columbia Gas 
Transmission.  She researched her actuals and looked on Columbia Navigator 
under ENA and NFGD PA  and was unable to find volumes as invoiced. B&B is 
invoicing for 1302 mcf.  The Sitara deal that was used for March used CGAS 
Point  21 NYSEG  02 Constrained Citygate and has pricing of $3.30 as per the 
invoice. 

Can you give us any more clues as to where we might find this gas?  Some 
place else on Navigator? Can B&B supply us with some kind of statement?

Please let me know.

you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by

Subject: Belgium: Electricity and gas markets: recent amendments

On 24 October 2000, six Royal Decrees on the liberalisation of the energy 
(electricity and gas) market were published in the Official Gazette. Below is 
a breif summary of the decrees

Electricity matters: 

Eligibility of end users 
Elegiblility consumption threashold: 
currently 100 GWh, 20 GWh starting 31/12/00, 10 GWh starting 31/12/02 
Distribution companies are elegible, for the volume of electricity supplied 
to eligible clients within the distribution grid 
Registration requirements:
Elegible customers must provide the competent minister with all relevant 
information, such as the meter reading recording the supply of electricity 
over the previous year, and an evaluation of consumption in the next year.
For 2000,customers must register by 23/11/00, these customers will be 
elegible through 12/31/01
For all comming years, including 2001, customers must register by the 1st of 
Febuary of that year
Resistration must be renewed every year. (An official registration form is 
publish and will be available soon) 
 
Management of the transmission grid
At least half the Board of Directors must be independent directors;
The Board of Directors constitutes a governance committee composed only of 
independent directors.  This committee,s object is to:
propose candidates for appointments as independent directors; and
examine conflicts of interest between the system operator and any of its 
shareholders and report to the Board of Directors; and
rule on cases of conflicts of interest (managers and personnel); and
supervise the proper application of the Royal Decree.

The Management Board, constituted of independent members, is exclusively 
competent for the technical operation of the network.  

However, the system operator has yet to be appointed. The Council of 
Ministers may make this appointment in the next few weeks (maybe on 10 
November 2000).  The  guarantee to the right of access for the eligible 
customers, is not yet in force and shall come into force only once the 
appointment of the system operator is official.

Composition and functioning of the General Council of the CREG
The General Council of the CREG gives advice and recommendations on the 
electricity and gas market at the request of the competent Minister, a 
regional government or the executive body of the CREG.
The composition of the General Council has been amended to e.g. increase the 
representation of public authorities, and allow producers of renewable energy 
to be represented.

2.    Gas Matters
A large part of the Act of 29 April 1999 on liberalising the gas market is 
now in force.  However, most provisions now in force only empower the King or 
the competent Minister to issue (Royal) Decrees to implement the Gas Act.

Three provisions, in force since 24 October, may be singled out:

Electricity producers may buy the gas necessary to generate electricity, 
whatever their consumption.  However, the right of access to the network is 
not yet in force (same problem as for the electricity market).

Conflicts on access to the gas network may be submitted to the GREG, which 
has powers of conciliation and arbitration. An administrative court (""La 
chambre d'Appel"") will also be created to rule on this kind of conflict.  A 
Royal Decree regulating arbitration and the procedure in the administrative 
court still has to be issued.

>From the first financial year after 10 August 2000, Belgian companies that 
generate, transport, deliver, supply, stock or buy gas, must comply with 
Belgian accounting rules and keep separate books for activities of transport, 
distribution and storage of gas.

Below please find the decrees in french. Please let me know if you want them 
translated.

"
55,"The question is legitimate.  With the potential for exchanges among 
affiliates being very real, the only possible solution is to either prohibit 
affiliate participation or make iron-clad the confidentiality/non-disclosure 
agreement.  Of course, once you allow the affiliate to participate, being 
able to determine if an ""inappropriate"" transfer of information has occurred 
is almost impossible.  The other problem is that Enron has been an advocate 
of affiliate participation in the sale of assets, as long as the relationship 
was arms-length and no preferential treatment was provided.  As proposed, 
PG&E states that its affiliate will be treated the same as other bidders.  
So, I think that leaves us with buttressing the proposed confidentiality 
language to prevent such exchanges as much as possible.

We would also have to assume, for the information to be beneficial to PG&E's 
affiliate, that it would result in PG&E Gen obtaining the assets.  As 
proposed by PG&E, they would have to be the highest bidder, taking into 
consideration certain tax benefits associated with the sale to an affiliate 
(PG&E's proposal, not my assessment).  In other words, PG&E claims that the 
ultimate determination of the winning bidder is price.  If the result was 
that PG&E Gen paid more for these assets than anyone else, it becomes a 
little more difficult to claim that the auction was unfair.  

However, I believe that the ultimate determination is price, with a caveat.  
The caveat is acceptance by PG&E of amendments to the attached service 
agreements.  PG&E allows for bidders to submit amendments to the service 
agreements, but PG&E retains the right to reject the amendments if not 
acceptable to them.  PG&E Gen may know what amendments are and are not 
acceptable.  That may be the inside track for the affiliate.  But again, I 
think it brings us back to ensuring equitable treatment as much as possible 
in the auction protocol rather than preventing PG&E Gen from participating.

If you feel this is not adequate, please let me know.

Jeff pointed me to you.  Below are some concerns I have on the PG&E hydro

how strong are the mitigants against this behavior?

Jeff,
Who is handling the PG&E hydro auction?  

I have a concern about PG&E Generation's participation in this auction.  
Every press release from PG&E on this topic goes out of its way to state that 
PG&E Gen will be a bidder.  My concern is their access to non-public 
information and how this may skew the results of the auction.  If you're the 
person on this, let's talk.  If not, pls let me know who is.  Hope you're 
doing well.

63,"Thanks for forwarding Peter's resume.  By copy of this memo I am forwarding 
Peter's resume to Danny McCarty and Phil Lowry.  Danny and Phil: Please 
follow-up with Vince if you have an interest in meeting with Peter.  He seems 
to be a very qualified candidate.

Subject: Follow-up on SIAM Workshop

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with 
Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor 
fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

Subject: Follow-up on SIAM Workshop


I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

----------


Continuing the current trend of large-scale mergers and acquisitions, it was
announced today at a press conference that Christmas and Chanukah will
merge.  The new mega-holiday will be know as Chrisnuka
>
An industry source said that the deal had been in the works for about 1300
years, ever since the rise of the Muslim Empire.
>
While details were not available at press time, it is believed that the
overhead cost of having twelve days of Christmas and eight days of Chanukah
was becoming prohibitive for both sides. By combining forces, we're  told,
the world will be able to enjoy consistently high-quality service during the
Fifteen Days of Chrisnukah, as the new holiday is being called.  Massive
layoffs are expected, with lords a-leaping and maids a-milking being the
hardest hit. As part of the conditions of the agreement, the letters on the
dreydl, currently in Hebrew, will be replaced by Latin, thus becoming
unintelligible to a wider audience.
>
Also, instead of translating to ""A great miracle happened there,"" the
message on the dreydl will be the more generic ""Miraculous stuff happens.""
In exchange, it is believed that Jews will be allowed to use Santa Claus and
his vast merchandising resources for buying and delivering their gifts.  In
fact, one of the sticking points holding up the agreement for at least three
hundred years was the question of whether Jewish children could leave milk
and cookies for Santa even after having eaten meat for dinner. A
breakthrough came last year, when Oreos were finally declared to be Kosher.
All sides appeared happy about this.
>
A spokesman for Christmas, Inc., declined to say whether a takeover of
Kwanzaa might not be in the works as well.  He merely pointed out that, were
it not for the independent existence of Kwanzaa, the merger between
Christmas and Chanukah might indeed be seen as an unfair cornering of the
holiday market. Fortunately for all concerned, he said, Kwanzaa will help to
maintain the competitive balance.
>
>He then closed the press conference by leading all present in a rousing
rendition of ""Oy, Come All  Ye Faithful.""

70,"Jason,

The following comments are an indicative response to the questions you asked 
during our phone conversation on Tuesday 4/3.  The following comments are NOT 
an additional pipeline proposal for the Murphy Medusa Project or an addendum 
to Enron's Medusa Pipeline Proposal.  There is insufficient time for Enron to 
obtain management approval of the following comments before Murphy's 
estimated recommendation date of Friday 4/6.  However, given additional time, 
or if awarded an LOI, Enron would work quickly to better define the issues 
discussed herein.
    
AMI Step-down:  As you and I discussed, Enron believes that the expected NPV 
of the risked AMI production volumes are in line with Enron's level of 
un-garranteed risk.  However, Enron would be willing to negotiate an AMI 
tariff step-down after a defined level of AMI production.  Notionally, Enron 
would be willing to consider a 25 percent AMI tariff reduction after 70 
million bbl and 100 million mmBTU of AMI production for the oil and gas 
export lines respectively.            

Abandonment:  The O&M charges proposed in the Pipeline Structure were set to 
partially recoup expected abandonment costs.  If Medusa produces 70MMBOE, 
Enron would expect to have some abandonment liability.  Moreover, Enron's 
actual abandonment costs could be significantly higher than initially 
estimated due to rig availability, inflation or, most importantly, regulatory 
changes.  Secondly, we have assumed no pipeline residual value.  No pipeline 
residual value is a reasonable assumption, given that in the Pipeline 
Structure, Enron would have no influence over the re-deployment of the FPS.  
Moreover, even if the pipelines were sold, the sales price would recognize 
the net value of the pipelines after abandonment.  Thus, there would be no 
double dipping on abandonment costs.

Oil Transportation:  Enron's understanding is that the $0.70/bbl for 
transportation from WD 143 is still a reasonable transportation estimate.  
This transportation cost estimate would be negotiated with Equilon after the 
execution of an LOI.

$30MM CAPEX Scenario:  Per your request, Enron has investigated a scenario 
where Enron would buy the oil and gas export pipelines from Murphy at a fixed 
price of $15MM each at the start of production.  Then, export pipeline 
capacity would be leased to the Venture, Venture Partners and 3rd party 
producers.  Based on a preliminary investigation, the Medusa production 
tariffs would reduce proportionately to the CAPEX.  Therefore, the tariff 
traunches for the oil and gas export pipelines would be:
$0.40 / bbl, $0.33 / bbl and $0.10 /bbl for the oil export pipeline
$0.35 / mmBTU, $0.14 / mmBTU and $0.07 mmBTU for the gas export pipeline

Thank you for the opportunity to bid on the Medusa FPS and export pipelines.  
Please call me if you have any questions concerning the above comments and/or 
Enron's previously submitted Medusa proposals.  

Regards,

Kenneth Loch

a)	SPC - Philippines:  Support the sale team through providing regulatory due diligence to the current draft regulatory law.  Emphasis is placed on articles affecting grandfathering contracts, in addition to full assessment of the draft.   Lead:  Mike Grimes		
2)	Asset Acquisition:
a)	Nicaragua Privatization: Support the acquisition team through providing regulatory due diligence.  Lead:  Alberto Levy

As these services have been demanded by the above individual business units, kindly remember that business units should pay out-of-pocket costs, if any.

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks

77,"
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

1. Overall Sentiment

The financial press spent the prior weekend while I was in
South Beach ""apologizing"" for Alan Greenspan's Jan. 11
remarks concerning the dim prospects for an economic
recovery in 2002.

Stocks continued to decline.

It took an actual appearance by the Maestro himself to give
stocks a boost. In an appearance before a Senate committee,
the Fed Chairman practically repeated his Jan. 11
statements. However, he also asked that the market
interpret them in a bullish light.

It did.

The result was three straight days of rally following a
sell-off on Tuesday in the holiday-shortened week of Jan.
21-25.

Those up days helped the popular indexes close out the week
with slight gains.

The value of my ShareBuilder plan of 33 stock positions
also closed out the week with a slight gain of less than
1%.

The big winner in this passive, buy-and-hold portfolio, for
the week was Alliant Tech (ATK).

In the sake of fairness, the biggest loser was Micro
General (MGEN).

That's encouraging, of course. But, where will investors,
mainly the institutional crowd, decide to place client
money after the flood of Q4 earnings results subsides?

Investor's Business Daily this past week noted that there
were net inflows of money into the overall market during
October and November. December's preliminary figures
indicate some net outflow of funds from both stocks and
bond funds.

Indeed, the rally since Sept. 21 appears to have stalled,
particularly for the larger capitalization issues in the
Dow 30 and the S&P 500. The mid and small cap averages,
although down from levels reached earlier this month, have
been hit less hard.

IBD also notes that money continues to flow into value and
small cap stock funds and away from large cap and growth
funds.

In the paper's ""20 Rules for Investment Success"" section,
Rule 19 says, ""Find out if the market currently favors big-
cap or small-cap stocks.""

A check of the daily new highs list does corroborate the
trend that smaller capitalization issues remain in favor.

First Data Corp. (FDC), an S&P 500 component, and currently
held in my ShareBuilder account, did reach new highs last
week.

That has been the exception rather than the rule.

Wednesday's CNBC Squawk Box segment featured a regular
guest economist from a Wall Street firm (can't recall the
firm, but does it really matter?)

The economist opined that that the ""plan vanilla small and
mid cap companies"" would treat investors well in 2002,
while the Big Dogs would experience a rough and rocky road.

Unless they're in the industry, many investors don't know
about these small and mid cap stocks. We tend to shy away
from the unfamiliar and prefer to stick with the familiar.

This worked during the roaring 90's. The bear market of
2000 and 2001, though, has taught us that celebrity stocks
can experience periods where only the most devoted of fans
stick with them.

The question investors must answer is: Will the market
continue to like plain vanilla, or it will gravitate to
chocolate, strawberry and the more exotic flavors?

More important, though, is how many scoops of plain vanilla
becomes one scoop too many?

For investors closely watching their ""investment calories,""
it is something to ponder.


2. Observations

On my weekly Saturday taxi ride to the supermarket, the
price for a gallon of regular gas at the convenience store
on Market Street was $1.03.99, down a whole penny from last
week.

Perhaps prices have stabilized for the moment. In fact,
we're hearing the word 'stabilized"" a lot these days in the
guidance offered by tech companies during the current
Earnings Season.

Tellabs (TLAB), the telecom equipment firm, comes to mind.
Reports by major brokers concerning the semiconductors,
particularly the equipment-making sector, maintain they
have seen the bottom.

When it cones to flavorings, in my view, it should be taken
with the seasoning of your choice.

Each Earnings Seasons also tends to produce some choppy, or
erratic, trading in stocks. Companies can report bottom-
line results that beat the forecast. Still, they sell off.

The usual excuse is that the speculators bought much
earlier on the rumor and sold on the news.

Sometimes, a good stock with rosy prospects will pull back
after reporting results because some Big Dog stock analyst
will say something like, ""Yes, earnings beat our forecast,
but the profit margin for the past quarter was down 0.1%
from the prior quarter, and that has us worried.""

So what else is new from Wall Street?

Meanwhile, IBD has begun a regular segment, ""The Smart
Investor,"" that profiles individual investors who practice
its investing and analytical disciplines.

After reading this segment for the past few months, I have
come away with the understanding that these folks don't
practice the buy-and-hold approach - as I understand it.

Instead, they constantly look for opportunities to buy a
stock that is just beginning its initial break out to new
highs. Then they monitor its progress from a standpoint of
how volume relates to price.

This means that on average, they aren't strictly buy-and-
hold investors, intending to stick with a position for more
than a year, much less several years.

In its most general of terms, the best way I know how to
explain this approach is to remind regular readers of a
situation way back in the early 70's when I used to hang
out in a branch office of a regional retail brokerage firm
in a small town in North Carolina.

A broker was on the phone with a customer. He told the
customer, ""A good stock is one that's going up, and a bad
stock is one that's going down.""

William O'Neil, IBD's publisher, puts it this way: ""All
stocks are bad. They're only good as long as they're going
up.""


3. Portfolio Results & Changes

In his books, audio, and video productions, Bill O'Neil
advises that individual investors should maintain a
portfolio of just a few stocks.

This goes against the grain of what is known as ""Modern
Portfolio Theory,"" an investment strategy that stresses
broad diversification.

Quite often, I hear the pundits on the TV stock market
channels say that an investor should put no more than 5% of
available capital into any one position.

What they are stressing is Modern Portfolio Theory, a
concept that was created in 1990.

This strategy is certainly suited for the so-called
""passive investor,"" or a person that doesn't have the time
to spend hours watching the CNBC tape or reading the three
sections of the Wall Street Journal from front page to back
page every day.

Indeed, diversification is a passive investor's best
friend.

Over-diversification, however, is a hazard for an active-
investor, or a person seeking short-term performance in his
or her positions.

The market only provides the active investor so many
opportunities to enter and exit with a nice gain. When that
opportunity is missed, due to watching too many stocks, the
overall results often suffer.

The stocks from the Ones to Watch Model Portfolio that I
inherited in February when I was assigned the task of
writing this newsletter, was eventually whittled down to
six stocks.

These six were purchased at the market open July 25. Six
months have passed.

Let's see how they've done, based on the Jan. 25 closing
price:

SEI Investments (SEIC), from 46.45 to 41.72, down 10%
Alloy Inc. (ALOY), from 15.37 to 19.74, up 28%
Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPDI), from 36.76 to
28.85, down 22%
Daktronics (DAKT), from 9.12 to 7.06, down 23%
EarthLink (ELNK), from 16.42, to 9.30, down 43%
SonicWALL (SNWL), from 20 to 20.36, virtually unchanged.

After six months, there is only one winner, Alloy Inc.,
which is somewhat of a surprise.

Internet fans should be familiar with EarthLink. Perhaps
that is the problem facing this sector of the economy and
the stock market.

The company continues to report deals and good news about
itself, but the bottom-line results from the quarter ended
Dec. 31, and the guidance says this ISP that has to
constantly has to compete against giant America Online
won't pass muster, despite favorable court rulings that
allows it access to the same POP telecom lines dominated by
AOL.

Daktronics is a micro cap company that makes electronic
scoreboards, a business that does well when times are good.

However, times aren't so good, and the company continues to
issue guidance that says future results, like EarthLink's,
that will fall short of Wall Street expectations.

I have to give up these stocks to what I suppose are the
bottom-fishers.

As the saying goes, ""One man's junk is another man's
treasure.""

As for the replacements that I hope will make up for a 43%
loss and a 23 ,respectively, here are the picks that I will
""purchase"" at the market open on Wednesday, Jan. 30 (the
second day of a two-day FOMC meeting!):

Internet content company eUniverse (EUNI), a micro cap
company that is beginning to hit the so-called ""radar
screen"" of institutional type investors (read: micro cap
funds).

In a PR dated Jan. 24 from Los Angeles, the company
reported a Q3 profit versus a year-old loss and raised
guidance for both revenue and earnings for Q4 ending March
31, and for fiscal 2003.

The company recently acquired for between $50-$55 million
online advertising firm L90 (LNTY).

The second pick is PETsMART (PETM), the No. 1 pet products
chain. Tuesday, Jan. 22, the Phoenix-based firm raised
guidance for its fiscal Q4 sales growth and said that it
will consolidate its PETsMART.com into its overall
operations.

This company has been running a lot of TV ads lately to
retail customers, but the company is certainly more diverse
than that, having catalog operations that sell products to
the horse market.

Believe it or not, the U.S. horse market is bigger than one
might think. Giddy-up!

My water-stock portfolio purchased Aug. 1 - Tetra Tech
(TTEK), American Water Works (AWK) and SCP Pool (POOL) -
are all in the black, with the AWK being the best
performer, up some 30%.

I also initiated a position in Philadelphia Suburban (PSC),
a water utility, in my ShareBuilder plan on Jan. 22. I also
intend to add more shares in 2002.

The two retail positions taken on Jan. 3 - long Bed, Bath &
Beyond (BBBY) and short Tiffany & Co. (TIF) - have thus far
been an embarrassment.

BBBY was bought at 33.49 and closed Jan. 25 at 32.40 for a
paper loss of 3.25%. TIF was sold short at 31.05 and closed
Jan. 25 at 35.38 for a paper loss of 14%.

Bill O'Neil has said the stock market is neither efficient
nor rational.

Here's BBBY, a consistent 30% grower in the home furnishing
market giving positive future guidance, with a trailing 12-
month P/E ratio of 47 that I'm paying a 17% premium to own.
Meanwhile, TIF, famous for its Robin's egg blue gift boxes,
sells at a trailing 12-month P/E of 31, even though the
management projects a growth rate in 2002 in the single
digits.

I still track this Sweet 16? portfolio of high-profile tech
stocks that was created in late July. Space limitations
won't permit me to report on the latest results, but I will
provide a list of the group:

Business Objects (BOBJ), Veritas Software (VRTS), i2 Tech
(ITWO), Micromuse (MUSE), Alcatel (ALA), Nokia (NOK),
Comverse Tech (CMVT), Vodaphone Group (VOD), Genentech
(DNA), Network Appliance (NTAP), Check Point Software
(CHKP), EMC Corp. (EMC), Juniper Networks (JNPR), CIENA
Corp. (CIENA), BEA Systems (BEAS), Corning Corp. (GLW).


4. Alexander, Iliana & Maneva

A trio of 123jump.com correspondents recently issued
thoughtful reports on its home page.

Alexander Vantchev reported Jan. 15 on BEA Systems (BEAS),
which I track through the Sweet 16? In an e-mail, I
provided Alex with this group of 16 stocks and also made
particular mention of Business Objects (BOBJ), the French
business intelligence software firm.

Alex views BEAS as a survivor niche player in the
enterprise software space that can manage to hold its own
versus the Big Dogs - Oracle (ORCL), International Business
Machines (IBM) and, of course, Mr. Softee (MSFT).

BEAS is scheduled to report earnings in February, since it
operates on a fiscal that is one month after the
traditional periods that end in Dec.-March-June-Sept.

The URL for Alex's report:

SEE: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?tory_id=13979

In some brief e-mail correspondence with Alex, I asked him
about the Russian stock market, the best performer of all
the world's exchanges in the past 12 months.

""And don't even look at Eastern European markets,"" Alex
replied, ""if you don't know more than a lot about them.
They are not real, or at least they are much, much
different from those in the West. These numbers can be
anything local lords want them to be. Russian economy's
margins are virtual. Nickel Paladium (Norilsk Nickel) is
produced in Siberia by what is very close to slave labor.
Gas (Gazprom (OGZPF) just runs down a pipe and someone
controls the tap. In the East, the politicians control the
business and not the other way round as elsewhere.""

Given what has happened with Enron (ENE), American
investors might tend to quibble with that last statement in
Alex's e-mail.

Speaking of the non-traditional fiscal year, the
overwhelming majority of American retail companies complete
their fiscal year Jan. 31.

They do this because of what they like to call the
Christmas Sell-Through Season that also accounts for the
period in January when they mark down items in order to rid
their shelves of excess (read: the stuff that didn't sell)
inventory.

In other words, when it comes to retail, investors should
be mindful of what I like to call the ""Philadelphia
Department Store Marketing Philosophy"" - Get it off the
shelf, it's been on the shelf too long.

Come February, 123jump.com's retail correspondent, Iliana
Sahandjieva, will have her hands full digesting the latest
financial results from this broad and diverse group that
actually makes up two-thirds of the U.S. economy.

On Jan. 22, Iliana issued a report on three discount
retailers, each with the name ""Dollar"" in their corporate
monikers.

SEE: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id_13985

Given what has happened to K-Mart (KM), one group of
financial pundits is saying that Wal-Mart (WMT), Target
(TGT) and the up-and-comer Kohl's (KSS), will continue to
take market share from the original creator of discount
retail, which was first known as E.J. Corvette's.

The other group of pundits is saying that by declaring
bankruptcy, K-Mart is a great speculation.

But, the same has already been said about Enron and Exodus
Communications. Monday, Global Crossing (GX) joined the
growing list of companies seeking Federal protection from
creditors.

Meanwhile, the retail distributor of lottery tickets gets a
little cut from each purchase.

In other words, buy it at 2 cents, sell it at 4 cents.

It's something to ponder. When it comes to getting that
""little cut from each purchase,"" I'll stick with the
position in my ShareBuilder plan of First Data Corp. (FDC).

Moving on to 123mump.com's third correspondent, Vanya
Maneva, we come to an emerging branch of technology known
as ""nanotechnology.""

SEE: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=13983

In a report issued Jan. 21, I would have to agree with
Vanya's assessment of this technology that it is something
for the future, something along the lines of at least 10
years into the future.

Going back to an earlier time in 2000 when I used to
correspond with a colleague (prior to its purchase by
123Jump.com) about the biotech industry, I mentioned that
Watson & Crick discovered the double helix in 1954.

My colleague commented that it took nearly 40-45 years for
this scientific breakthrough to actually become a profit-
making enterprise for only a handful of biotech firms.

I think Vanya has provided a balanced, yet factual,
approach to this emerging branch of technology.

Of course, folks that have an interest in this field would
like to see Wall Street bring these companies public on an
ASAP basis, much like the dot-com mania IPO market of 1999.

So far, Wall Street is taking a ""wait and see"" approach.

Don't hold your breath for nanotech.


5. The Paradox of the Fed

As was promised in an earlier newsletter that I would make
comment about the Federal Reserve System, which we now
usually refer to as simply, ""The Fed,"" it seems that the
more things change, the more that they appear the same.

Yes, we all know that Alan Greenspan, former Jazz musician,
has been at the helm of the world's most powerful Central
Bank for something like 18 years.

Still, I want to remind readers that the Federal Reserve
System was created through an act of the U.S. Congress in
1912.

There are what I would term ""constitutional sticklers""
among the readership who maintain that this legislation,
were it ever to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, could
actually be declared unconstitutional.

We all know this won't happen - at least in the years that
I left as an inhabitant on the Big Blue Marble.

Given the recent comments from Alan Greenspan and how it
affected the stock market, I think that it is appropriate
that I include a passage from Richard Ney's ""The Wall
Street Jungle,"" a book that was published in 1970, and is
now only available through used-book sources:

""Because the Fed is part of the 'financial community' under
the aegis of the Stock Exchange (see Chapter 9), the values
and the ideology of the Exchange have become absolute and
now impose themselves on the credit policies of the nation.
The Fed's wisdom in raising interest rates is now revealed
as no more than a myth: in the words of Congressman Wright
Patman, 'for the Fed to raise interest rates in order to
cure inflation is like pouring gasoline on a fire to put it
out.'""

I find it interesting that during 2000 and 2001, Alan
Greenspan constantly ""bitched"" about inflation as it
pertained to the price of a gallon of regular gas before
the various branches of the U.S. power structure, while
also providing his usual oblique explanations as it
pertained to the economic concept of ""wage push inflation.""


6. From The Readers

Larry W. e-mailed with the following comment about a stock
he's strong on (as is Wall Street) these days:

'I enjoy your comments and have been getting your e-mails
for a couple months. When you bought MIMS for your nieces,
I checked it the next day and [it] started down and I
placed a buy order at 10 to think to steal it on the way
down. It never filled and I now I kick myself for not
accepting the good fundamental and just buying with stops.
I later saw it in IBD highlighted in yellow.""

Larry W. continues: ""Another yellow stock is UTSI, which is
a California company with a near pure play on the wireless
market in China. Last fall, I did a tour of the major Asian
cities and could see the great amount of development. UTSI
has Asian officers in their mid-forties and a growth rate
of about 40%, but also a PE above that level. They report
earnings and have a webcast on Jan. 28, 1:30 PST. Visit
www.utstar.com. Keep up the reports and weekly trips to the
store.

Meanwhile, here's a URL, courtesy of Yahoo! Finance of
UTSI:

7. Sonny T's Latest Picks

Our ex-IBM employee turned full-time trader e-mails me
nearly every day about his stock picking/stock trading
system.

Sonny T wrote Sunday, Jan. 27, that his system is
increasing his positions from $10,000 to $11,000 per
position from a couple of weeks ago ""to put the profit to
work.

In my view, this is a good trading strategy. Using the
profit to buy more stock actually results in what we are
all seeking: The Power of Compounding.

Or, as Albert Einstein put it: ""The most powerful force in
the Universe (at least from an investment standpoint) is
the power of compound interest.""

When it comes to investing, there are winners and losers.

For those folks who read IBD, particularly as it pertains
to the Smart Investor segment, there are folks out there
who make a personal commitment to be consistent winners.

Or, as Sonny T puts it in his latest e-mail: ""My goal is to
make money. This system provides great opportunity, but the
trick is to refine a way to make money with it
consistently.""

I like the way Richard Ney, as it pertains to investment
success, defined consistency: ""Better a steady dime, than a
seldom dollar.""

As for the picks, Sonny T says his system currently likes
AVNT, BZH, CHBS, CTX, DFXI, DHI, FCN, FRED, GISX, GTK, LEN,
MIM, RGIS, RIT, TTIL.

I find it fascinating that his system has picked Regis
Corp. (RGIS), a nationwide chain of hair salon studios.

Talk about a ""plain vanilla stock""!


8. Basing Patterns

A colleague, Bob Howard, who publishes a monthly fee-based
newsletter from Springfield, MO that I receive for free,
calls his product, ""Positive Patterns.""

Bob is a buy-and-hold guy who won't back off from his stock
picks. One of them is a food stock, Smithfield (SFD). Talk
about a company that is ""shareholder friendly,"" if you're a
person, to use the term this TV celebrity chef Emeril
LaGasse uses, ""Pork Fat Rules,"" then Smithfield is the
stock for you.

As for this Basing Patterns business, Richard D. Wyckoff,
an early pioneer in technical analysis, was always on the
lookout for stocks moving sideways within a narrow range.

Investor's Business Daily often writes about stocks
displaying stock charts in basing patterns.

Like IBD, Wyckoff, who published a newsletter in the first
20 years of the 20th Century, was picky as it pertains to
""basing patterns.

Wyckoff and IBD share a common analytical criterion:
""tight"", as opposed to ""sloppy"" base patterns.

In other words, the base should be in a rather narrow
range, which indicates that speculators are avoiding the
stock. It also implies that professional investors are
making careful bids for the purpose of accumulating a good
line of shares at a price that falls within a certain
target range.

Here are charts, courtesy of Yahoo! Finance, that display
what I like to call ""Wyckoff Patterns.""

85,"Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they 
rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and 
don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the 
columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled 
Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they 
need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to 
keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian ""logic.""

And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an 
email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the 
first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 
million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted 
the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if 
that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her 
at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian 
p&l and for the originations total.  

Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country 
capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT 
stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.

I'll whine more later,

Today's focus: Be VigilEnt on Linux

By Phil Hochmuth

Network administrators who have multiple Linux instances
running on IBM's iServer hardware might want to try out
VigilEnt Secure Agent, a new security tool specifically built
for this IBM hardware/software combo.

IBM's xServer iSeries is based on the familiar AS/400 hardware
platform, but has been modified to run up to 31 ""instances"" of
Linux, or Linux partitions. The VigilEnt security software,
made by Houston-based PentaSafe, works with SuSE Linux
partitions on IBM's eServer iSeries midrange machines.

The software can be used to run system security audits on a
Linux partition to account for potential misconfigurations or
""back doors"" that may be present on a Linux partition. Such
lapses could allow data to be seen by users who do not have
access to a particular partition, or leave a Linux partition
open to an external hacker.

The software can lock certain files, such as system
configuration files, on a Linux partition from use. The agent
can also be installed across multiple Linux partitions and used
to synchronize security settings and produce audit reports for
multiple Linux instances on one iServer.

Running multiple Linux instances on a single IBM iSeries could
help businesses consolidate the number of servers deployed in a
network, according to IBM. Such a setup could have separate
Linux partitions running e-mail, application, database and file
storage servers on one machine, which would appear as four
separate servers to clients on a network.

 I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of comparing 
the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.  Once I 
finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to Enron 
Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will let you 
know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the deal contact 
for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know when it has been 
signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be. 
 If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart execution 
which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by WPSC.  
 Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A copy 
should be sufficient. Don't you agree.

"
98,"Shelley,
I'm glad we made the decision to participate in today's drafting session.  There were only nine of us involved, with Ed Ross, Skip Simmons and Craig Chancellor representing the generators, while Byron White, Georgia Carter and myself were there to represent the pipelines.  The others were with the Alliance.  Ed was his usual self.  He was confidently making the good economic case why the pipelines should consider the generator's position and how/why the FERC would likely side with them.  Craig tried to frame it commercially, and Skip played peacemaker.  Byron and I played a little ""good cop/bad cop"" on behalf of the pipes, with Byron being the bad cop.  

Anyway, sum and substance, I think we'll be more pleased with the next draft of this document than what was submitted to us recently.   The first sentence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of the parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to physical operating considerations.  There emerged a realization that maybe two products are being contemplated here:  (1) a product that blocks out a period of time for uniform deliveries (say, 8 hours), and (2) a product that basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed upon block of capacity.  It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less valuable than the second, and priced accordingly.  Byron and I argued that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated, and in fact, may be physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline.  The generators originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights were carved up by hour, (ex. an 8 hr. block of 5,000/d could be repackaged as two 8 hr. blocks of 2,500/d).  I'm not sure whether we got consensus there or not -- we'll have to see the next draft.

The big ticket items (nos. 8, 9) got the most press.  I was troubled by the generators' interpretation of both.  In the case of no. 8, the generators wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a firm service (whether FT, NNS or storage) could, pursuant to the conversion formula, remarket their original firm service as NURF.  The generators were looking at this provision as ""throwing a bone"" to existing customers who might want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity (ex. seasonal) that may not be fully utilized.  Obviously, the predetermined conversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines, as well as the whole notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole (ie. two or more different product types).  We pointed out the services were all different, and in fact, any combination of those services, conceivably, could be repackaged under today's rules and sold as a proxy for NURF.  I believe we were successful in taming that language down substantially.  However, be on the lookout for the next draft.

Finally, with respect to no. 9, where the generators want receipts considered rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF, the generators had an intersting slant.  Essentially, Ed was saying that he didn't want the pipelines to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines were the only ones who could offer NURF.  By requiring the pipelines to consider rateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria, then Ed said the generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for ""NURF-like"" service.  Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at Westar in West Texas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to a power plant located at the California border was probably unworkable.  However, he also posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same storage service at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas could be adjusted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant (a sort of diversion of gas theory), then the pipeline should be operationally indifferent to whether it was providing NURF service or a 3rd party was providing a NURF-like service.  They just want others to have the ability to compete with the pipeline.

Of course, the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be the same.  Moreover, accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could conceivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on (IT, LFT, etc.) as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the pipeline's NURF service.  Skip scratched out a more tame version of no. 9, and Ed agreed to consider it.  Be on the lookout for what they come up with.

Overall, as I said, I'm glad I was there, as well as the other pipeline representatives.  I hope that we were successful in getting the generators back on track here.  I'll be interested in seeing how much of our discussion today is embodied in the next generator draft.

I told the group they were in trouble on Thursday, as we were sending in the ""A"" team.  Good luck and call if you have any questions.

Subject:	Principles for Generator Discussion


This week there are two scheduled pipeline/generator sessions.  Today, the generators will be meeting with a small group of pipelines in a drafting session.  On Thursday, the third meeting of the larger pipeline/generator group is scheduled. 

Last Friday, I faxed you a copy of the latest strawman for a NURF service with my comments. I noted that the strawman is moving in the wrong direction.  I decided to formalize these thoughts into our own set of principles.

Jeff Fawcett will be representing our viewpoint at the drafting session today & I will cover the dialogue on Thursday.  Let me know if you have any other feedback.  Of course, anyone else is welcome to attend these meetings with Jeff or I.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 2
>From 6:00 - 9:00 a.m., the Envision team will re-index the databases.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16
>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

Good suggestion.  I spoke to Scott Rebltiz who told me that important 
decisions are to made this week at OPIC concering the Gaza project.  I will 
work with Scott and John Hardy to make sure that our message is consistent 
and helpful.  I will also work with Mac for a comprehensive update and 
strategy.

Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power 
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but 
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want 
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs

I have slightly revised the talking points to incorporate the concept of FERC 
jurisdiction over reliability and to note that there are procedural options 
for DOE and/or FERC  --  actions that can be taken immediately (DOE emergency 
authority) and longer-term solutions (the CRT or Petition for Rulemaking).

March 13-16th.  Got a room at the Mirage and it is $120 per person for the

I also found #550042 and 550048 that look like it needs to be confirmed also.

I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
is there another deal number?

Thanks,

Subject: Not to be confirmed deals

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious 
decision or something the comuter is defaulting to.  Am I making sense?  Call 
me if you need to interpret this message!

      Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
   e-mail.
      I'm
      doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the
   market
      for
      a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your
   quest
      for a
      Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of unemployment,
   I
      don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage.
   Tara
      and I
      will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on
      throwing
      back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth
      together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin and
   get
      as
      accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre. Go

Energy Committee Members and friends,

I will be off on vacation this week from April 9-13, returning on the 16th.
Not that I won't miss you all and the issues
of great interest and drama, but it is past time to take a holiday with my
children on their spring break with some camping on the coast.

With John Redding also out this week on the shores of the Mediterranean in
Nice, France and K.C. Mares buried in his Exodus obligations,
Derek Naten of Roche Bioscience has graciously agreed to chair the energy
committee meeting this afternoon.  There is much
to discuss at today's meeting with the Governor's proposed rate plan and the
announced Chapter 11 reorganization by PG&E and your guest
speakers on energy R&D, Terry Searles of the CEC and Clark Gellings of EPRI.

Laura Goldseth will also ably respond to your needs this week as she is
able.  Her phone number is 408 501 7870.  I will stay in touch and
be able to respond to emergencies by phone.

Have a great week.  I look forward to seeing you again soon.

Will,

Can you tell me what day was the last to be rolled in Auto Scheduler?  I'm trying to go back into December to balance Enpower for Settlement purposes.  

Thank you,

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

131,"This looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed?  I don't want there to be any other surprises, so I'd like to include ""known and unknown"" type language here.  Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?  Let's be very clear.  I'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys.

133,"Thanks for your note.  Agreed that execution on IMI and II (construction, debt and equity closings) are the key for the Americas.  It looks like we will have slippage for Q2; I am expecting to see European numbers later this morning and will give you a call to discuss on Friday.  We can also discuss the gearbox issues for the US as to which I am a bit more optimistic than my earlier reports.  Adam

It sounds like the due diligence with UBS is going fairly well with no real surprise.  The news is good on Indian Mesa I and II both on the deal with AEP and the financing.  The real target is completion of the project on time.

I am concerned about slippage again on Q2 due to the Greek project slippage and German installations being behind schedule.  I am looking forward to seeing the Q2 numbers very soon.

What is the issue on the L&S gearbox and what is the potential impact on 01 earnings given your statement that if we do not pass the test, it will present significant problems for 01 US sales.

Let's talk by phone this week if possible.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Robert Stephenson

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
""It took too long to bring this to resolution,"" said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. ""I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt."" 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
""We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges,"" Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
""Let's hope cooler minds prevail,"" said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
""It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California,"" said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 


Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
""We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there,"" he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt ""smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court."" 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.

154,"Dear Mr. Zunic,

Pursuant to the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am attaching a sample form of our 
Master Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529 
if you have any comments or questions.
"
155,"	Stan, the Bushton Team met yesterday and decided that there is no value and substantial risk to Northern in accepting OneOk's suggestion that we rewrite the Bushton Measurement Agreement to operate like the OneOk-Kinder Morgan Scott City measurement agreement.  We are reluctant to incorporate the PTR formula in any way beyond the limited purpose it serves under the current Measurement Agreement.  The following are talking points that Dave Neubauer will use today in a conversation with Terry Spencer, who is Steve Winston's boss.  Since Winston's proposal (which I sent to you by email last week) was a draft and has never been formally sent to us, we decided that having Dave deliver our message to Terry made more sense than sending a letter or elevating the issue to your and John Gibson's level.  However, if Gibson calls you and raises the issue of their proposal, the following points contain our message.  

	Spencer may agree in the call with Dave to reconcile the April and May imbalance based on our metered numbers.  If not, Britt has prepared a demand letter that can be sent at any time to get resolution of that issue rolling.  I believe that Gibson indicated that he'd be calling you back this week to talk about this matter, so your conversation should take place before we send the demand letter. I'll forward the demand letter for your review separately. 
 		
	On the other proposal from OneOk that I forwarded to you last week (relating to operational changes designed to allow OneOk to get the helium plant running again), we have made some minor modifications and are sending the counterproposal back to OneOk.  We expect to get that deal in place with them soon.  This is a good development for them, and with little or no risk to us, and should temper any disappointment they feel because of our rejection of their measurment proposal.   

	Please give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks. DF



 

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a ""BTU measurement error"" (i.e., when the chromatograph malfunctions).   

2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the Oneok meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration. 

3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a ""special test"" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.

4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.

5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.

Subject: Conflicts Clearance fir ECT/Procter & Gamble  Swaption



Alan, this e-mail confirms our discussion earlier today in which you
gave clearance to Sutherland Asbill & Brennan to represent another
existing firm client, Procter & Gamble (*P&G*), with respect to a put
swaption for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft that Procter & Gamble
wishes to enter with Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  You
clearance on behalf of ECT is based upon my description of what
Sutherland has been asked to do by P&G, which is to review the ISDA
documentation, provide comments and negotiate with ECT, if necessary.
We understand that ECT*s clearance given to Sutherland to work for P&G
on this matter is for the specific transaction only.  Moreover, we
assure you that if ECT and P&G do enter into the swaption and a
dispute between the parties arises related to the swaption, Sutherland
would not represent either party with respect to such dispute
regardless of forum.

Please let me know whether you have any other questions regarding this
matter.  We appreciate ECT*s willingness to accommodate Sutherland in
this matter, and continue to value our relationship with Enron.

157,"I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.

Can we discuss?

Thanks

The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is

the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

163,"I gather that Bob will be spending most of his time on the securities litigation.  Is it still possible to get a litigation manager to  handle EES matters.  I would hope we could use one of the EWS litigators, as we discussed earlier.  Having someone on the floor would be a definite plus as well. I had talked to Andy but  never finalized because of the crisis situation we are in.  My main concern is that the EES business not be allocated among numerous litigators so that we do have accountability  or take a back seat to other assignments.  Thanks.

I have 2 different ones.  I know you changed it.  I just want to make

I'll just make sure my volumes on storage match with the schedule and

Can you send me your revisions with the discounted price and commodity
charges applied to the planned storage injections today or tomorrow?  I
really need that ASAP to see if our numbers are getting any closer.  
I believe that the fuel calculations are being taken into account for
the

Young Storage.  I was planning on calling you after I saw your
revisions.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

This is my stab at a consolidated list from the last 2 weeks.  We may have to

Hi Stephanie, I will get the final version of ECT - Goldman International 
agreement by the end of the day  onThursday and there is a lot of pressure to 
get it executed right away.   Tomorrow can you prepare and execute the 
accompanying documents.  For ECT's Authorized Traders List, you need to add 
Mark Schlueter (doublecheck spelling and phone number) to the list of 
traders.  This is a HIGH priority.

Please also revise the the trader list for both the ENA (add Peter Schluter) 
and ECT  (add Mark) in order to execute the Deutsche Bank agreements we 
discussed today.   We also got calls today about getting this one executed  
since we already have signatures from Deutsche Bank.

Thanx.

Subject: RE: Restated 2002 CAPEX Plan


Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.

207,"Hi Folks,

Like you, I'm scrambling to try and find anything on Edgerrin James this
afternoon.

As of 4:27 EDT, the latest I have is he says he'll be fine isn't especially
worried.   I do NOT however have news on how the MRI results came back.   As
soon as I do, I'll shoot to you.   If things go as they usually do, I'll get
the new information about 2 minutes after I send you this update...  Oh
well.

Sticking with the ""You'll Know What I Know"" philosophy, here's what I have
for now:

http://starnews.com/print/articles/sideb26.html

Clipped from the Phillip B. Wilson article:

James Assures Everyone He'll Be Ready for Next Game

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Peyton Manning had the same sinking feeling a week ago,
staring in disbelief as one of the Indianapolis Colts' famed ""Triplets"" went
down and stayed down with a leg injury.

""I don't like it at all,"" the Colts quarterback said. ""There's no
replacement for Edgerrin James.""

The durable James had his left knee bent awkwardly by Kansas City linebacker
Marvcus Patton with 4:26 remaining and the Colts clinging to a 28-21 lead
over the inspired Chiefs on Thursday night at Arrowhead Stadium.

A grimacing James looked up and eventually caught the eye of Pro Bowl
teammate Marvin Harrison, the Triplet who gave his teammates a scare when
his leg buckled in the third quarter last week.

""I told him I'd be back,"" James said.

James didn't make it back for the Colts' 35-28 triumph, but that wasn't his
decision. He said he wanted to go back into the game.

The NFL's two-time reigning rushing champion is expected to have an MRI exam
today, just to be safe, but he isn't worried about being ready for the next
game, Nov. 4 at Buffalo. He joked with teammates after his shower and didn't
even have ice on his knee.

""I'm going to be all right,"" he said with a smile.

""Something wasn't right, I felt some pain and knew something wasn't right.
Then the pain started to go away, so I knew it couldn't be too bad.""

James caught everyone by surprise. The Pro Bowl runner has been as rugged as
he's been consistent. He has 151 of the Colts' 184 rushing attempts this
season for 662 yards. As a rookie out of the University of Miami, he had 369
carries for 1,553 yards rushing. His second year, he upped both totals to
387 carries for 1,709 yards.

""I was shook up,"" Harrison said. ""I was shook up last week when it happened
to me and Edge was more worried about me. This time, I was shook up about
him.

""You don't think that about Edgerrin. Him being down awhile was scary.""

Manning, one of the last to enter the Colts' triumphant locker room, stopped
at James' locker and tapped his tailback on the shoulder.

""How is it?"" the quarterback asked.

""I'll be all right,"" James said, for seemingly the hundredth time.

Despite missing the final minutes, James finished with 102 yards rushing on
27 carries. That gives him 24 100-yard rushing games in his 38-game NFL
career, tying Eric Dickerson for the most in Colts history.

Colts coach Jim Mora also didn't seem worried that James' injury might be as
severe as it looked on slow-motion television replays.

""I don't think it's serious,"" Mora said. ""They were in there examining a bit
ago. I think he'll be OK. I can't give any prognosis about next week. We do
have a little longer time to recover and hopefully he'll be ready.""

On the first play of the final quarter, James broke free on third-and-one
and ran 20 yards to the Chiefs' 33. It set up Mike Vanderjagt's 42-yard
field goal to give the Colts a 20-14 lead with 13 minutes remaining.

On the Colts' next offensive series, Manning audibled at the line of
scrimmage and hit Harrison for a 47-yard touchdown pass. James added two
points, catching a Manning pass in the flat and running to the left corner
of the end zone to give the Colts a 28-14 lead with 8:21 left.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


I'm still wanting to hear official word.   Knee injuries are weird.   The
first time Jamal Anderson wrecked his knee in college, he stayed in the game
a good while after the injury.   Just because James says it doesn't feel too
bad, doesn't have him out of the woods yet.   Stay tuned.   If you can grab
Dominic Rhodes with little cost, it might not be a bad idea.   If nothing
else, it'll be fun for taunting the James owner in your league.

If you hear anything on James, shoot me an email at bryant@footballguys.com
and I'll spread the word the rest of the guys.


Joe

208,"The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

209,"I am forwarding some Wall Street comments from Kathryn Corbally related to 
the Transmission buyout.  

Looks like they view it as very favorable - not a major hit against EPS tied 
to full recovery of remaining undercollection.  

Not sure yet if they incorporate the going forward - maybe SCE doesn't want 
any merchant obligations?

Date:     February 26, 2001
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Highlights:
-  On Friday (2/23), Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of 
   California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle 
   for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial 
   recovery package. He also commented that ""good progress"" was made with 
   Sempra Energy and ""some progress"" with PG&E Corp.
-  The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edison's 
   transmission system for approximately $2.76 billion (2.3x estimated book 
   value) and allow for the securitization of ""a substantial portion of its 
   undercollection"".
-  In exchange, Edison would: 1) make payments of approximately $420 million 
   to its utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison; 2) commit the 
entire 
   output of an Edison Mission project at cost-based rates for 10 years; 3) 
   provide cost-based rates from native generation for another 10 years; 4) 
   give conservation easements on 20,000 acreas of watershed lands for 99 
   years; and 5) drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public 
   Utilities Commission.
-  We view this agreement as a positive development. Based on the 2.3x 
   purchase price, the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would 
   be approximately $0.10 lower than our worst case estimate (at 1.5x) of 
   $1.90 . The agreement, however, is not final and additional details need 
to 
   be worked out before being submitted to the legislature.
-  Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include: 1) a definitive 
   agreement with Edison; 2) deals with PG&E Corp. and Sempra Energy; 3) a 
   package that the legislature can accept (which could include concessions 
   from generators); and 4) terms that are acceptable by the FERC.
-  In our opinion, the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and 
   renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis. While our optimism is 
   tempered by the shortening timeframe, we are encouraged by the governor's 
   recent statements, which have been more positive than negative. As such, 
we 
   maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PG&E Corp as well as 
   on the generation companies: Calpine and Dynegy.

Other News:
In other related news, on Friday (2/23) Edison announced that all of its banks
have agreed to extend their forbearance until March 14.

EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov Davis.PCG still negotiating.Buy EI

           
    

*  On February 23, EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal
   in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow
   for recovery of a 'substantial portion' of unrecovered cost in return
   for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping
   pending litigation.  This settlement appears to be a  reasonable 'shared
   pain' scenario and is consistent with the 'buyout vs. bailout'
   structure we have been anticipating. To be enacted the deal needs to be
   finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature.
   FERC also must approve the asset sale.
*  EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the
   state of California for $2.76 billion and transfer $420 million cash to
   its utility subsidiary from the parent.  In return, the state would
   allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its under-collected power
   costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate
   hikes.  If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this
   agreement, in concert with passage of ABX1-1, would eliminate the
   overhang that has depressed EIX shares.
*  Although dependent on several factors, we believe the net impact on
   earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX
   stock price implies.  We believe post-settlement EPS in 2002 will likely
   total at least $2.00/share, which supports a conservative valuation of
   $20 share (10X '02 EPS, a 20% valuation discount to the peer group).
*  Also late last week, PCG issued a press release indicating they had met
   with the Governor, had submitted proposals, and discussions were
   ongoing.  With the framework already established for EIX, we expect a
   PCG settlement could be announced in the near future. PCG's negotiating
   flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates
   are lower, their under-recovered balance is higher, and the potential
   cash 'refund' from parent to subsidiary being requested by the
   government is probably larger.
*  PCG's transmission system has a book value of roughly $1.5 billion.  At
   2.3X book value, these assets could potentially be worth $3.5 billion.
   Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the
   one proposed for EIX, we estimate PCG would refund $780 million. PCG's
   stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied
   by a settlement of this nature. We believe a deal like this would
   support post-settlement EPS of at least $2.50/share which supports a
   conservative valuation of $25/share (10X '02 eps, a 20% valuation
   discount to the peer group).
*  Because EIX has a 'deal in principle' the stock is trading at a premium
   to PCG despite having lower potential 2002 earnings power. Those
   investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in
   structure and proportional to EIX's settlement should purchase PCG over
   EIX at this juncture.

Reason for Report:  Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison; PG&E 
up
in the air; Need all 3 utilities to move forward



Investment Highlights:
o    On Friday, Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison
International (EIX; D-2-2-9; $14.69) on a financial resuscitation plan.  The
plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor.

o    The state will purchase Edison's transmission assets for $2.76B, or 2.3x
book value.  This would help pay off some of Edison's net $4.1B of
undercollections (a number agreed upon with the Gov.)  The remainder will be
recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be
carved-out of Edison's rates.

o    In exchange, Edison will agree to: 1) Drop the lawsuit against the PUC, 
2)
Invest $420M back into the utility from the parent, representing tax
overcollections , and 3) Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost-
based rates for the next 10 years.  Edison also agreed to sell power from its
unregulated Sunrise plant, currently under construction, at cost-based rates
for 10 years.

o    A number of uncertainties remain in Edison's deal, and it is still
preliminary.  The exact terms and language will be very important, 
particularly
given the need to issue securitization bonds.  It is impossible to provide
exact earnings guidance based on this deal, but the only loss of earnings 
power
would appear to come from lost transmission earnings (-$0.20-$0.25/share) and
potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of cost-based
rates.

o    This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the 
CA
power credit crisis.  However, it could be for naught if the other utilities
cannot work out deals.  We believe Sempra Energy (SRE; B-2-1-7; $22.10) is
relatively close, but PG&E's (PCG; D-2-2-9, $13.70) talks were flailing last
week.  We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and
pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board.

o    We believe PG&E is willing to work a deal within this framework.  
However,
the simple problem is that PCG's undercollection numbers are much bigger.  At
YE 2000, PCG's net undercollection was more than $5B and we believe this may
have reached $7B by the end of January.  Selling the transmission for 2.3x 
book
would provide only $3.5B, leaving the other half to be recovered though the
dedicated rate component/securitization.  It may be that the only way the
numbers can work is with a rate increase.

Despite the significant hurdles that remain, we believe the momentum toward a
constructive outcome is improving.  To that end, we maintain our Accumulate
ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts.

I can ask our Phoenix counsel if he can set up a meeting or give us an idea who can.  The head of APS transmission is an attorney (who actually represented us for a brief moment) who left Snell and Wilmer in June.  I can call him as well.  Dave, what does your schedule look like?

Let me cogitate on this.  The local counsel we use on electric matters is more of a gas attorney than an electric one, and the counsel we use for the SW Gas matters is also APS's counsel so he can't help us on these matters.  The customers are no allies, since they are happy with their deal, and the only other marketer who was active in the settlement is gone now (the internet marketer from California).  Perhaps we could talk to APS to see what they are thinking.  That might be more enlightening than anything else.  Just a thought.

I would think that we should take the time to talk with local counsel or other ""allies"" to get a feel for the chances in AZ.  I also think that the difficulty in AZ will be a physical problem with getting transmission service - no RTO.

It would be great to have a thorough analysis of problems in every open market just to know what the issues are.

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

I have received 2 calls in the last two days from EES and ENA (Lance Hinricks and David Porter) wanting to know the details of AZ electric marketing.  They are apparently revisiting things there.  So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.

It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn't - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.

That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).  We would have no one on our side.  

SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them, given the less than great odds.

Are we (or EPSA) taking an active role in the filing APS made with the Arizona Commission to use the unregulated affiliate of its parent as the wholesale provider of last resort?  (There's an article on the filing in today's Electric Power Daily that says they've filed to push back the requirement that they purchase 100% of their power from the competitive market by 2004 to a requirement that they purchase 25% of their power competitively by 2008).

AtHome dialed Excite's number and Compaq is on hold....


AtHome agreed to purchase XCIT today for $7 billion. This was
a significant premium over the current stock price but when
you are an Internet stock this could be a one day move.

Rumors are flying that Compaq is preparing to make a major
Internet purchase maybe as early as tomorrow. Lycos is the
most mentioned possible target.

This Internet mania helped power the Nasdaq to another record
close and is credited with pulling the Dow out of another
valuation worry induced profit taking session. How can you
be bearish about the market in general when the tech stocks
are continuing to beat earnings estimates and blow away whisper
numbers.

Microsoft announced after the close and showed just how big
the $5 bln gorilla really is. The $5 bln was sales for last
quarter. MSFT announced $.73 vs estimates of $.59 and blew
away the whisper number of $.62. Microsoft was trading up +5.00
after the close. There was no split announcement and this could
be attributed to the trial publicity. They don't want to appear
too prosperous for the penalty phase. The conference call was
typically pessimistic as they tried to keep a lid on analyst's
estimates for the future. I would expect MSFT to gap open on
Wednesday.

The futures are up +6.50 at 7:10 ET and we give the credit to
MSFT and several other announcements after the bell. The fly
in the ointment could be the Alan Greenspan testimony tomorrow
in Washington. He is sure to be asked some ""irrational exuberance""
type questions and the answers could be earth shaking. Some
analysts say Mr. G. has been criticized so severely by congress
for his previous market moving performances that future comments
will likely be constrained. Don't bet the farm on this. Alan
is tasked with many insurmountable projects one of which is
keeping the U.S. markets under control. The recent Internet
""froth"" is something that other Fed governors have pointed at
in the past as a sign of a speculative bubble. So even though
the futures are up now, we may see some weakness before the
testimony. If we get by without any earthquake comments then
the week could continue up strongly. The Brazil problem could
even be a muzzle for Mr. G. Better to be quiet than roil the
markets and have to lower rates again next month to rescue them
again.

Clinton gets a major play tonight with the televised State of
the Union speech. He is under a strong spotlight as people look
for signs of cracks in the presidential armor. What should he do?
Pull out some heavy firepower! He is planning just that. Clinton
will unveil his support for a plan to take some Social Security
funds and put them into the market in a retirement savings account
program. Estimates in the $500-700 bln range are being tossed
about. This is not a new concept but his support for this popular
plan is new and timely given the other problems he is facing.
Maybe we should keep his feet to the fire longer if he is going
to do us favors like this. Not only would I rather my Social
Security was gaining ground in an account of this style but can
you imagine the market impact of a $700 bln inflow of cash?
Don't count your chickens yet but stay tuned for plan details
if it is ever approved. Opponents claim losses could occur if
a long term bear market were to appear.

I got considerable email about the 10% plan in Sunday's commentary.
Some good and some bad. Most of the good came from traders that
started putting this type of plan into action several months ago
when I wrote about it last. Most of them have multiplied their
accounts by several hundred percent. The negative mail seemed to
come from readers that were new to the newsletter and had small
accounts and were adamant that you should only settle for 200-300%
returns on every trade. We will see what kind of mail I get several
weeks from now when we start publishing the results from the readers
who are going to implement the plan. I had many readers email that
they were going to faithfully try it and report back. Good Luck!
The first ten who can show ten trades will win a years subscription.
Anybody can still play. Just send a recap of your completed plays
after 1/17/99 using the 10-20% plan from Sundays newsletter.

This is going to be an interesting week. Keep your options open
and make those trades. With the put/call ratio at .42 and the
advances only barely beating the declines 1506/1492, we are not
out of the woods yet. Tommorrow could be another record breaker
for the Nasdaq but the broader market internals are still weak.
Just three stocks in the Dow accounted for over +60 points today.
T +7.75, IBM +7.06, GM +4.69. The odds are real good that these
stocks will not be the leaders tomorrow and new leaders are hard
to find. Without these huge gains today we would have been very
negative. -46 without accounting for the positive impact they
had on other Dow components. Keep your fingers crossed.


Good Luck

Jim Brown

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
************************************************************

Option Speculators Quiet ahead of State of the Union Address

With the State of the Union Address and Greenspan scheduled to
speak tomorrow, not much was revealed in the market today with
respect to market sentiment.  Pinnacle is still tracking what
option speculators do over the next couple of days for clues as
to where the broader market is likely to go.

We are entering a new expiration period and therefore some of the
indexes and put/call ratios will become volatile over the next
couple of days as options traders establish new positions.

Pinnacle is still concerned by the excessive Bullish sentiment as
tracked by Investors Intelligence latest poll - 60% Bullish, %30
Bearish.  This is the highest level for bullish sentiment that
we have seen for a while.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing bearish
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding
market sentiment can be directed at:

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.


CALLS:
******

None.


PUTS:
******

XCIT $110.00 +42.50 (+42.50) Gapped up on buy out news from
At Home (ATHN). Represents one of the biggest Internet deals
to date. Pinnacle, therefore, dropping XCIT. It does
underscore one of the benefits of buying a put instead of
shorting the stock. Only the premium is lost on the $42 gap.

BMCS $41.50 +1.44 (+1.44) Pinnacle dropping software firm
after BMCS closed above key $41 benchmark and the Software
Index (CWX) closed in record territory.



PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************
SUNW $105.31 +4.88 (+4.88)  This could be a huge week for
Sun Microsystems.  Already, the horses are off and running.
On Tuesday, Sun added +$4.88 to set another all time high in
intraday trading at $105.44.  In an awesome display of
strength, it broke and held above its former resistance level
of $104.50.  Maybe the move was propelled by some formidable
press releases.  Royal Philips Electronics NV and the Sony
Corp. will announce an alliance with SUNW.  The plan is to use
Sun's Jini, a form of the Java programming language, to develop
software that can network entertainment devices and appliances
by using the Internet.  The Sharper Image, Digital Video
Express, 1-800-FLOWERS, Egghead.com, Inc., and Brite Voice
Systems have all turned to Sun's highly reliable servers,
storage, and software products to handle their growing needs.
More than likely the stock is taking off because of Sun's
earnings announcements which are due out after the market
closes on Thursday Jan. 21st.  Earnings estimates for SUNW
are $0.66.  Along with a solid earnings report, we are
predicting a 2:1 stock split announcement.  SUNW last split
in November of 1996 when the stock was trading near $60.
With 950 mln shares authorized and only 380 mln outstanding
they have plenty of room for a split.  After MSFT's huge
earnings explosion, the techs should take off tomorrow,
but then again investor enthusiasm will be fighting
investor fear with Greenspan speaking on Wednesday.

MYG $64.69 +0.44 (+0.44)  Maytag is looking good so far this
week.  The turn around in the market on Tuesday seemed to
help Maytag add +$0.44 on the day.  Hopefully the market will
continue to stabilize and help MYG challenge its latest
resistance level of $66.00 which isn't too far away
considering Maytag inched up to $65.25 in intraday trading.
Maytag announces its earnings on Feb. 4th and remains one of
our split candidates.

FTL $18.00 +$1.31 (+1.31) Even though we are playing FTL as a
take over play, (on rumors), with this weeks news that the
clothing maker is now the exclusive apparel supplier for
all 56 Planet Hollywood Cafes, FTL still opened on a down
note.  But picked up the pace and shot up to $18.75 for
the daily high, then settling down to close at $18.00.
Rumors had a $23.00 buy out announcement coming on last
Tuesday but as we all know, it didn't show. FTL is still
showing volatility, so be careful with this one.

CCU $63.13  +$2.69 (+2.69)  CCU was added as a play this
weekend and did not disappoint us on the first day of trading
News about this new concept in Internet communications
(digital radio) is all around the street.  By investing
in the research that will carry Net surfing to new levels,
CCU might just catch that big wave.  CCU opened and tested
it's support of $60.00 by dipping its toes below the water
line at $59.62.  Then came up for a big gulp of air to
$64.00, and caught a good wave to finish at $63.12 on
the day. Protect your profits, while watching for tomorrow's
next call of ""surfs up""!

EMC $102.13 +2.06 (+2.06) EMC just keeps going up.  It set a
new 52 week high today, and closed at the high.  There was an
interesting article at MSN MoneyCentral comparing EMC and its
rival NTAP.  An observation by the article was that every bit
of new e-mail, every sale over the Internet, and every extra
page view increases the need to build more storage into the
Internet.  It also pointed out that EMC has just begun selling
software to its customer base.  Software sales are expected to
grow from $400 million in 1998 to $1 billion by 2001.  EMC
reports earnings before the open on 1/26 (next Tuesday).

JBL $73.75 -.13 (-.13) JBL keeps bouncing around and off its 21
day moving average which is currently at $72.82.  We really
need something to get this stock going again.  We have not had
any news, and JBL doesn't release earnings until March.  JBL's
two main competitors, SLR and SCI, both went up today.  JBL has
been following these two, so maybe JBL will start moving up.
Otherwise, its chart is starting to flatten out and it looks
like its momentum is slowing.  Wait for confirmation of upward
movement before initiating any new trades.

UTX $109.00 .69 (-.69) UTX gapped open this morning and then
traded down the rest of the day.  There was an article today
about the run that UTX has been on since October in seeming
defiance of a slowing global economy.  UTX does about 55% of
its business overseas.  Analysts pointed out that the company's
forecast of 15% growth in 1999 has been one of the keys to its
recent run.  UTX releases earnings this Thursday.  Only play
UTX if the Dow is moving up, otherwise wait for the earnings
release on Thursday to see which direction UTX is headed.
There is the possibility of a split announcement with their
earnings but we don't feel that strongly about it.

QCOM $66.50 +2.63 (+2.63) QCOM announced earnings today of 65
cents per share and blew away the estimate of 59 cents per
share.  QCOM also reported the highest quarterly revenues in
its 13-year history.  Revenues were $941 million for the first
quarter of fiscal 1999, an increase of 20 percent over the
first quarter of fiscal 1998.  Net income for the first quarter
was $49 million compared to $37 million for the first quarter
of fiscal 1998, a 32 percent increase.  In other news, QCOM's
joint venture with Microsoft announced their first service
offering, named Revolv.  Revolv is a service that will provide
mobile professionals with secure access to information using a
variety of wireless or mobile devices form anywhere they
travel.  QCOM should have no trouble with its old 52 week high
of $67.38 tomorrow.

DELL $82.13 +3.13 (+3.13)  More un-noticed, great
news.  ""Dell has become a force to be reckoned with in the
personal workstation market,"" said Tom Copeland,
workstation analyst at IDC.  ""Dell's workstation market
share grew at 186 percent, substantially more than the
industry average of 36 percent, and far more than any other
vendor""(Business Wire). Dell is now tied with Hewlett
Packard as the number 1 producer of personal work stations.
They announce new products weekly without fanfare.  Dell
closed at a new all-time high today on average volume in
the wake of stellar NASDAQ gains.  Volume was 14 million
shares, a little light for our taste.  But we'll take a $3
gain any way we can get it.  Look for Dell to move up more,
market permitting.  Wait for small pullbacks to scale into
a position.  Earnings to be announced February 16.

CSCO $106.38 +4.69 (+4.69)  Cisco closed $0.12 off its
high of the day.  Nice show of strength on 21% higher
than average volume.  No earth shaking news, but
Cisco has announced 3 new programs to not just sell
equipment to service providers, but design, manage and
implement its installation for maximum efficiency and least
cost to the client.  More important to the bigger picture,
CSCO is the big beneficiary in developing the Internet,
including providing equipment for the AT&T/TCI deal.
Looking strong, but after 3 days of higher closings, keep
an eye out for the dip, and then make your move.
Resistance is $108.  Still a split candidate.  Look for
earnings February 2.

AOL $150.50 +4.00 (+4.00)  Not much AOL news since last
week.  Today's Internet spotlight held all eyes on @Home's
proposed purchase of Excite, which should have thrown some
competitive cold water on AOL, but it didn't.  Even on 60%
of average volume, AOL added $4.00.  We'll feel a lot
better when AOL adds volume to confirm the upward price
movement.  In the meantime, AOL adds more tension to the
rubber band as it consolidates toward a ""snap"" date between
now and earnings scheduled to be announced on January 27th
after 5:00pm ET.  AOL is also a split candidate at these
price levels (over $120).  We anticipate a split along with
earnings.  For the next couple of days, target shooting
your entry to coincide with the dip after opening should
get a better entry.  As always, confirm market direction
first.

WCOM $77.25 +2.19 (+2.19) Baby Bells lost another one in
court today in an attempt to over turn provisions of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 which are effectively
preventing from entering the long distance business.  Under
the Act, the Bell companies are prohibited from offering
long distance service to their local customers until they
have opened their local networks to competitors (Reuters).
Though this is beneficial for all long distance carriers,
WCOM appeared to be an indirect beneficiary of AT&T news.
Today's volume was 20% over average, a very good sign.  We
look for WCOM to test and break through resistance of $79,
having cleared $76 easily.  The more conservative play is
to wait until it breaks $79 and holds.  But in light of the
telco sector's momentum, we can make a case for jumping in
after confirming market direction.  Just don't try to catch
a falling knife if profit taking sets in.

T $91.50 +7.25 (+7.25)  Welcome to what seems like
the newest Internet play.  Michael Armstrong, AT&T's
chairman, is trying with measurable success, to turn the
Queen Mary on a dime, from a copper-based dinosaur to a
broadband fiber based communications powerhouse.  AT&T is
actually a big beneficiary of @Home's offer to purchase
Excite.  Here's why:  @Home's largest shareholder is TCI
who is about to be absorbed into AT&T.  With Excite, AT&T
now has a substantial ""portal"" to the Internet which can be
delivered over TCI's cable infrastructure.  AT&T had, from
what we could tell, its largest 1-day gain ever on volume
exceeding the average by 80%.  Resistance has been
obliterated.  The sky is the limit, market pending.  Watch
out for profit taking on such a large 1-day run-up, and buy
the dip.

MSFT $155.63 +5.88 (+5.88)  MSFT blew away earnings
estimates true to form, by posting a fiscal Q2 net of $0.73
a share, well ahead of the First Call mean estimate of
$0.59.  Revenues rose 36.8% to $4.9 billion.  As of this
writing, we have heard no news of a split just yet.  But in
after hours trading, the stock was up $9.00 in the $164
range.  For those of you with a position held over earnings
(which we normally don't recommend), congratulations.
Remember to protect your profits with stop-loss/stop-limit
orders.  Also, don't use a market order to enter a play in
the morning, you could be filled at the high of the day.
Instead, if MSFT sells off in the first 30-45 minutes of
trading, enter the play on the rebound.

PICK NEWS CONTINUED
**********************************************************
TLAB $84.63 -1.31 (-1.31)  No news to be found on
TLAB today, just old-fashioned profit taking on 1/3 less
than average volume.  This really is a ""buy the dip""
opportunity.  We still like TLAB and expect further gains
when investors de-couple from today's Internet magnet.
Confirm upward direction before entering a play.

DIS $36.50 +.50 (+.50) Disney edged a little higher today.
A judge dismissed the $20 million that had been awarded to
Children's Broadcasting Corp. when Disney ended it's
agreement to sell national advertising for a Children's
Broadcasting deal with AAHS World Radio.  Meanwhile,
Infoseek, Disney's partner in the Internet portal GO
NETWORK (and 43% owned by Disney), has completed its
acquisition of Quando, another Internet company.
Infoseek's Ultraseek Server powers the web site search
capability of many top private and state universities, as
well as several corporations.  A report shows a drop of 1%
in all theme park attendance in 1998. However, for Disney,
that may not be too great a cause for concern. Its Magic
Kingdom saw a 23% jump in attendance only the year before.

NOKA $144.00 +5.38 (+5.38) Nokia blasted to a new intra-day
high today of $145.75, and set a new closing high as well:
$144.00.  Nokia has chosen to use the high performance,
highly secure processing products made by Chrysalis-ITS.
Separately, Dolphin Telecom, of France, has chosen Nokia to
supply and install the infrastructure equipment for its
Tetra digital wireless communications network in France.
Nokia plans to double production of mobile phones at its
plant in Bochum, Germany to meet increasing demand. The
entire telecommunications market is hot now, and Nokia is
one of the top ten providers of telecommunications products
in the world, and the leading maker of cellular phones.
Looking strong, Nokia is also a split candidate.

MU $73.00 +1.69 (+1.69) Micron gained $1.69 on the day,
even as Novellus dropped after reporting earnings only in
line with analysts' expectations. The pre-earnings run-up
for Novellus had been driven by investors' expectations.
Robert Maire, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin, and
Jennette, issued cautious statements about the semi-
conductor industry. He believes that it has not started a
full recovery yet and chip stocks are ahead of themselves.
Intel and Micron must not have gotten the news, for they
were both up today.  Intel's numbers showed a 12% surprise,
and Micron is reportedly doing well this quarter.  MU's
current quarter doesn't end until February, though, and
earnings won't be out until March--enough time for a bit of
an earnings run.

PRIA $35.50 +1.00 (+1.00) Up a full dollar is a decent rise
on a $35 stock.  In fact, this stock was only down one of
the last 5 trading days, and that was on a down market day.
PRIA has been steadily climbing since its early December
correction and it looks like it intends to keep going. The
same factors helping the semi-conductor industry will help
drive up this stock: increasing demand for computers and
other equipment that use chips, and a decrease in the
formerly overabundant supply of chips.

LXK $102.38 +4.31 (+4.31) LXK had a stellar day today with its
rise of 4%. This seems to be a pre-earnings run. We have
noted in past commentaries that LXK has had earnings runs of
an average of $6.00 over the last four quarters. It seems that
this quarter will be no different. There is added expectation
that LXK will announce a split. We have the earnings date as
January 25th. If we hear different we will update you. LXK had
an interesting article written about it's trials in selling
printers to China. The problem wasn't the printers themselves,
but the paper they were printed on. The paper was so difficult
that LXK sent reams of paper to their researchers and told them
to develop a printer that would print on the ancient paper. Shows
the extent at which companies are willing to go in this world
economy.

ATI $92.63 +9.25 (+9.25) ATI did as expected and gapped open
on Tuesday. The open was $95.75, over $3 above the close of
the day. ATI and VOD have stated the deal needs to be completed
by December 31st, 1999. The deal states that ATI shareholders
will get 1/2 share of VOD plus $9 in cash. This will cause the
value of the deal to change as time goes by. ATI is obviously
trading well below the true value of the deal, but this is
common until the deal is finalized.  If you want to play
the rest of this deal (since currently ATI should be worth
$101.25 based on VOD's close today):

*We suggest waiting for the next dip.
BUY CALL FEB-85 ATI-BQ OI= 6868 at $10.00 SL=7.50 ITM $7.63
BUY CALL FEB-90 ATI-BR OI=10024 at $ 6.88 SL=5.25
BUY CALL APR-90 ATI-DR OI=  658 at $ 9.25 SL=6.75

LU $114.06 +3.81 (+3.81) LU had a pretty good day on Tuesday
and closed just $.75 off its highs for the day.  We are now
just $6 from LU's 52-week high.  We have verified LU's earnings
date.  Earnings will be announced before the market opens on
the 21st of January (this Thursday). We are seeing a nice
earnings run which should continue until the earnings release.
Watch for pullbacks to initiate new plays. There are always
times to purchase, just be patient and buy the dips.

XIRC $42.00 +2.13 (+2.13) XIRC shot up today on the expectations
of it's earnings announced after the close today. We had the
earnings date as January 21st, so we apologize for the mis-
information.  For those of you that are holding XIRC, the
earnings came in at $.39 a share.  This is $.04 more than
estimates and a penny ahead of the whisper. If anyone is
thinking of buying into XIRC, wait for a pullback after the
gap open.  XIRC's earnings were $.11 same quarter last year.
XIRC unveiled high-speed ISDN data support for its Global-
Access RealPort Ethernet+Modem and modem-only integrated
PC cards. This technology connects notebook PCs at 128Kbps.

COF $131.50 +1.06 (+1.06) COF announced earnings today and
they came in right on estimates of $1.04. This originally
pushed shares of COF down slightly. As the day played on,
COF traded up and ended up at its high of the day. The whisper
number was the same as the estimate. COF is sitting right
around its 52-week high. If the market continues to trend up
then COF should be a leader. Their earnings rose from $.86 a
share in the same quarter last year.  We were a little bit
disappointed that they did not announce a split.  We are
guessing that COF's management does not have a split clause
in their compensation.  They receive some pretty big bonuses
if they can get COF's share price to $175 within the next
2 1/2 years.

CHKPF $55.50 +4.25(+4.25) CHKPF took off today and closed just
1/2 a point off its intraday highs. CHKPF blew by its prior 52-
week high on strong volume. CHKPF's earnings are on the 21st,
and we are seeing the effects of an earnings run. CHKPF has
historically blown away earnings estimates. CHKPF's last five
earnings surprises have gone like this: 13,22,28,23,78. These
are percentage surprises. Numbers like these cause an earnings
run. Though a split isn't eminent, they do have shares to do
a split.

ETH $49.56 +.63 (+.63) ETH traded in a range of $49.13 to $50.75.
Not a bad day considering that ETH is not in the technology
arena.  ETH announced earnings on the 13th of January and beat
estimates by $.02.  The general feeling out there is that
furniture stores had a great holiday season.  ETH is still $17
away from its 52-week high.  This leaves a lot of room to go.

YHOO $323.00 +6.00 (+6.00) YHOO had an interesting day.  YHOO
opened at $340, which was a premium of $23 above Friday's close.
YHOO traded as high as $345 and as low as $318.  YHOO got it's
boost from the purchase of XCIT by @Home.  This has stirred up
speculation that other consolidation is in the works.  YHOO has
had a strong correction over the last week and this could be
the start of a new Internet frenzy. This remains a risky play.
Wait for upward confirmation.  YHOO continues to be a blue-chip
of the Internet.  The price of Exodus Communications rose 34%
from the mention that it is in a deal with YHOO. Remember, YHOO
has a split coming up at the end of the month (about 3 weeks).

F - Ford Motor Co. $63.94 (+1.94)

Everyone knows who Ford is and what they do, but did you also
know that Ford is not only the second largest producer of
cars and trucks but is one of the largest providers of
financial services in the world?

Not over twenty years ago, certain analysts had all but
the nails in the coffins of the U.S. Automobile Industry.
""A dying industry"" it was said to be, ""no innovation"", a
""lack of direction"", ""inefficient"".  Let's get back to reality.
Ford Motor Company has taken on a huge European market and
done quite well thank you.  Their recent acquisitions of an
aluminum stamping company, the assisting of Poland, which is
the second largest auto production country in Eastern and
Central Europe.  Plus recent media reports of Ford taking
a 10% stake in Nissan.  Almost forces you to take notice of
a company with all this potential.  We have and we are adding
Ford as a new play.

First call has Ford reporting earnings on this Thursday,
Jan. 21, while we don't recommend holding over earnings,
this play has a couple of more days of a possible run up to
the announcement.  If it posts a positive surprise, you may
want to consider jumping back in if you miss the run up.

COMBINATION PLAYS   Merger-mania dominates the telecom group...
******************************************************************
U.S. markets closed higher Tuesday and the Nasdaq hit a new record
high amid optimism about President Clinton's State of the Union
address tonight. The DOW closed up 14 points at 9355 after falling
significantly earlier in the session. Internet/Tech stocks soared,
driving the Nasdaq up 60 points to 2408.20. Traders said rounds of
program trading linked to stock index futures sent stocks lower in
the early part of the volatile session. Post-market earnings and
positive expectations forced investors to speculate in afternoon
trading and that led to a closing frenzy. Traders and analysts are
amazed that investors continue to demonstrate bullish sentiment on
Technology, Internet and Telecom issues.

Our portfolio was quite active, first the new plays: ABI was our
conservative bull-call spread (FEB45C/50C) and the prices near the
open were favorable at $2.87 debit. HUM was the calendar/time play
and the opening price for the MAY20C/FEB20C was $1.25. GMSTF moved
higher right away but there was an opportunity near 10 am to fill
the spread (FEB40P/45P) at $0.50. ELN surprised us with a morning
rally but the best we could manage without ""legging"" in was $0.75
credit for the FEB80C/75C bear-call spread. COF wandered for most
of the day, the average price for the FEB105P/110P credit spread
was $0.62.

Other activities: We closed the ATI (LEAPS/covered-calls) spread
just after the open for $9.50 credit. There just wasn't any reason
to risk a loss with a successful merger (shrinking volatility/time
values in the options) expected to occur. LU was another morning
exit and we closed the debit position for $3.00, (a $1.25 profit.)
FTL finally started moving again and the positive activity offered
an easy exit for our FEB15C/20C bull-call spread. A closing price
of $2.38 was available and after watching it fall last week, we
decided to take the safe route; $0.87 profit. LUV was up almost $2
at one point and the FEB22C/25C spread closed easily for $2.25 to
achieve a profit of $1.00. OXHP was a calendar position and we
opened the FEB20C at $1.25 against our existing MAY20C for a new
debit of $1.50. WCOM was another open calendar spread and we sold
the FEB75C for $5.25 to reduce the cost basis on our LEAP to $5.62.
NXTL was the final play and our GTC limit of $5.00 was filled near
the end of the day to close the call option. A profit of $2.12 was
the overall outcome for the position.

Other notable portfolio movers included: GM, up almost $5.00, SUNW
up almost $5 and CPQ was $3 higher on news of a possible Web-deal.

Today's plays are mostly speculative positions based on smaller
Internet and Telecom stocks. That's where the action is right now
and the speculation is fairly cheap...

******************************************************************
PTEK - Premiere Technologies  $11.38   *** Internet IPO? ***

Premiere Technologies provides enhanced communications services.
PTEK services include 800-based services, voice messaging,
enhanced document distribution and conference calling. Recent
speculation and heavy option volume concerning some of the new
technology from the company. Some say it involves USA.net and the
ability to listen to your email messages and post email via voice
from any touch-tone telephone. PTEK's communications management
technology may be used for their mail engine. Others are betting
that PTEK ownership of Usa.Net and Web.Md will create revenue if
either company goes public. The recent hype of internet IPO's
make this a favorable speculation play, using current momentum
and taking advantage of overpriced options.

PLAY (speculative):

BUY  CALL MAR-12.50 TQO-CV OI=18   A=$1.68
SELL CALL FEB-12.50 TQO-BV OI=2010 B=$1.06
NET DEBIT TARGET=$0.50 TARGET ROI=100%

OMPT - Omnipoint  $14.06     *** Telecom Takeover ***

Omnipoint offers digital personal communications services (PCS) to
16 million customers in the US as well as in 30 countries (via 45
international roaming partnerships) around the globe through GSM
(global systems for mobile communications) technology. Worldwide
PCS services are obtained by the use of a subscriber information
access card. Omnipoint also designs and sells phone handsets for
vendor partners including Ericsson, Mitsubishi, Motorola, Nokia,
Northern Telecom, Sagem, and Siemens. Just another small telecom
getting attention as the merger-mania continues. The short term
momentum has this stock over-extended but the risk is worth the
reward if it finds a partner. A March position gives us time to
sell-off some of the initial debit.

PLAY (speculative):

BUY  CALL MAR-15 QTT-CC OI=20   A=$2.25
SELL CALL FEB-15 QTT-BC OI=1156 B=$1.25

Secure Computing Corporation designs, develops, markets and sells
complete network security solutions, including firewalls, filters,
authentication and network services. Earnings are due shortly and
the whisper number is moving higher. SCUR is expected to maintain
a 30-50% growth rate and now option interest is increasing with
rumors of a stock split. Paine Webber reiterated a ""BUY"" rating
with a conservative target of $30. The technical outlook is very
bullish with recent support around $20 and heavy buying pressure.

We had a variance in the SAR for the West BOM Book on Friday night.  It was due to a 9 mw purchase from short term cali that was used to fill the lending we have with El Paso Electric.  We in a purchase from the imbalance under the WBOM Book (deal #727440), and built an annuity (deal #72741) where short term cali sold us the 9 MW @ $43.00.  If this is not the correct to remedy the variance please advise me of what to do next time.

228,"FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that 
this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the 
specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to 
get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., 
Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the 
Legislature as soon as possible.

In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed ""rate 
agreement"" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's ""revenue 
requirement"" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison 
and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's 
going to get very interesting from here.

229,"Good Morning Team,

Tribune Co. reported a net loss of $139 million for 3Q01, citing an advertising falloff, an expensive restructuring, and costs of news coverage in the wake of the September attacks.  The Chicago-based company, which owns 11 newspapers, 22 television stations, and more than 50 Web sites, had cut 6% to 7% of its work force because of the advertising slump. The attacks increased spending in the form of extra newspaper editions, extended coverage by its TV and radio stations, and increased capacity by its Web sites.  Revenue from publishing -- largely newspapers -- declined 8%  and retail advertising was down 7%.  For the first 9 months, the company had a net loss of $15.7 million, compared with year-earlier earnings of $168 million.  The trend continues as major media companies report their 3Q01 results...
Stay tuned for the market wrap this afternoon.

We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Subject:        RE: NICOR 

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Mark Walker will send a request to Germany for their availability data.  Mark 
will also provide the definitions of Machine availability.  The contractual 
availability is what was included in the memo I handed you when you were in 
my office on Wednesday.  If you need an electronic copy of that  document 
Mark can send it to you.

With respect to making us responsible (as the coordinator) for obtaining the 
Germany availability data:  We have no leverage over our European 
counterparts and cannot compel them to provide this data on a 1 day notice.  
I want to avoid setting expectations that are clearly beyond our control.  We 
will, however, give it a shot. 

I did notice the European data stops in Sep 01 so we need 6 months to fill in 
all the gaps.  Has Becky been unable to obtain any more recent data or is 
this the most current info you have?

Thanks,
Hollis

ACTION - PLEASE CALL TODD REID AT DUKE

BACKGROUND:
Below is the situation with Duke and subs:
						Exposure	Line		Cash		L/C	
Duke Energy Marketing LP / ECC		($43mm)	$10mm		$52.35mm	$20.5mm
Duke Energy Trading & Marketing / ENA		($56mm)	$5mm		$61mm
Duke Energy Trading & Marketing / EPMI		($260mm)	$20mm		$171mm	$100mm

The expiration of the letters of credit are 11/30/01.  Duke believes that since these L/C's have less than 20 days to expiry their value should be zero and are asking for additional cash collateral.  Our view of the contract is that these L/C's are good collateral until expiry and should be counted in our outgoing collateral.

The roll of the letter of credit has been delayed as Haedicke/Mintz get comfortable with the reps under the L/C facility.

Duke credit guys are saying that Todd Reid has not received a return call from you and this holding up a resolution.

Subject:	EES contracts

I wanted to bring you up to speed about some meetings we have been having regarding contract issues in the bankruptcy proceedings.

In connection with our asset sales, EES has been concerned about the deterioration in the value of the EES book as we receive notices from customers that they are terminating their contracts with us.  In general, our customers would not have the right to terminate EES contracts unless the contracts are considered forward contracts.  If the contracts are non forward executory contracts, the customer would have no right to terminate, and only EES as the debtor could effectively terminate by rejecting the contract.  

In any event, EES had been planning to write to the utilities where we had customer books that we are trying to sell, and state, in short, that the utility did not have the right to terminate our contracts with the utility because they were executory contracts, and that the utility did not have the right to process customer requests to switch  to other retail energy providers   because the customers did not have the right to terminate our contracts, since they were executory contracts. 

As we have discussed,  it is an open issue as to whether our contracts are forward or non-forward contracts.  The arguments that these contracts are not forward contracts would be based on the theory  that our customer is not a forward contract merchant, that retail contracts are much more than commodity contracts and include numerous other   services, and that the  contract can only be terminated by a forward contract merchant.  If we receive some offers to buy the retail books, claiming that our contracts are non-forward contracts would maximize the value of EES because the customers would be prevented from terminating their contracts and would not be switched to new  retail energy providers.  However, on a long term basis,  there may be advantages to any retail business on a go forward basis to consider these contracts forward contracts.  This would allow energy providers in the future to terminate upon customer bankruptcies.  

At the trading issues meeting  Janet, Mike and I attended yesterday, it was the strong view of the group that the best position for Enron in the bankruptcy process was that retail contracts were forward contracts, and that this position should be taken on an Enron wide basis.  I am assuming that we will want someone in a commercial role to confirm that this is the position EES is being asked to take for the benefit of the overall estate, and that we should not, in any letters we are writing to the utilities, describe our contracts as executory and subject to the automatic stay of the bankruptcy court.  I think we would go forward with other parts of the letter to the utilities that is not inconsistent with the overall positions.

Please let me know if you need more info.  Thanks.

Forwarding Kieth's report from last weekend of doe season.

Had to call him to get information on what made his heart race.

He saw Mertz's rib cage buck at boneyard, other side of the fence, said it
was 14 inches wide with tines that were incredibly long almost touching at
the top. he said 140plus, no problem.

saw brian's deer's younger brother at lonestar and said it will be a great
bucknext year.

While spotlighting bunnys saw a buck at the protien feeder at launching pad
that was unbelivable. He said he counted 12 scorable points, not including
several kickers he did not count. the deer was wide with aobut 8 to 9 inch
tines. walked with a limp on front right leg. Must be a nocturnal old
warrior, never seen before.

other than that he saw a smattering of does and yong bucks. feeders still
running.  e.

A quick update on the status of the receivables monetization initiative. 

First, I have been told that we will go forward with the financing with or without any merger. That said, the banks are worried that we will change our minds and are asking for a formal engagement letter, which means we lost a few days negotiating the terms of the letter.  I don't expect any new requests for data until Tuesday at the earliest, and more likely Wednesday or Thursday of next week (as Monday is a bank holiday).

Thanks for you help, I'll let you know of any changes as they develop.  have a good weekend.

Max,

Unify posted an update from Sitara for this Deal in Unify around 11:00 a.m. this morning.  When I was checking the data pretaining to this deal in the database, I noticed that there is no volume data for March 2002 which is one reason why you can't produce a statement.  Please get your Sitara contact to ensure March 2002 pricing data and volumes data exist in their system.  If it does not, have them enter it and repush the deal.  If it does, simply have them repush the deal.  Once this is done, please make sure the balancing process for this Contract is executed in Unify (this is typically run by Volume Management manually during the day or by the batch job in the evening).  Then you should be able execute the Draft process (also, please double-check and ensure a notification record was created for this deal in Settlements) and a statement should get created.

If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

272,"New Hurricane Forecast out of CSU

Renowned hurricane soothsayer Dr. William Gray and his team at Colorado State 
University have 
scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the 
season to be more active than 
average. Seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three 
of them are expected 
to be intense rather than the four expected in the group's prior forecast on 
June 7. In round numbers, 
the August forecast is for three named storms, two hurricanes, and one 
intense or major hurricane. 

""Information obtained through July 2000 indicates that the Atlantic hurricane 
season in 2000 is likely 
to be less active than the four recent very busy years of 1995, 1996, 1998 
and 1999. However, total 
activity is expected to exceed the long term average and is anticipated to be 
considerably more 
active than the mean for the recent period of 1970 through 1994. 

""We estimate that the 2000 season will have seven hurricanes (average is 
5.7), 11 named storms 
(average is 9.3), 55 named storm days (average is 47), 30 hurricane days 
(average is 24), three 
intense (category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.2), six intense hurricane 
days (average is 4.7) and 
a Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) of 90 (average is 71). Collectively, 
net tropical cyclone 
activity in year 2000 is expected to be about 130% of the long term average. 

The early August forecast update is in close to Gray's Dec. 8, 1999) and 
April 7 forecasts, but 
somewhat lower than his recent June 7 update. ""The forecast has been lowered 
slightly [because] 
June-July global circulation conditions have not progressed quite as 
favorably for hurricane 
enhancement than as we anticipated in our early June forecast,"" Gray said.

Have you tried Susan Scott?  She is the Book Admin that entered these and 
she's usually very helpful.  If you can't get in touch with her, let me know 
and I'll go up and see if I can get someone on that desk to move these over.

276,"Jim,

	In Denver you asked for our views on RTO Governance, i.e., preference for Stakeholder vs Independent Board.  As a basic principle, I believe that the key issue is independence energy marketing, generation ownership etc.  I have given each of these a grade from 1-10 based on my preference.

For-Profit Transco--Grade 10.  The best form of governance is the for-profit Transco.  It is governed by a independent corporate board and regulated by FERC.  Independence is a fact of corporate structure and regulatory restriction.  The Transco can take on delivery risk, building new facilities as necessary to meet customer demand.  The Transco is prohibited from taking any long term position in the energy market, and it is compensated only by system through flow (total load served and energy wheeled).  Unfortunately I think the likelihood of Transcos forming is remote.  The biggest obstacle is the difficulty of getting around the tax problems.  The LLP/LLC structures skirts the tax problem, but it also results in converting a sizable investment in to a passive investment with control by a minority owner.  I think the only way to get Transcos in the short run is for there to be a short window (2-3 years) when transmission owners have the ability to sell assets to a company combining assets, without taxes.  Those missing the window would have to pay taxes on a pre-sale merger transactions as they do now.  This would compel owners to determine if they want to be transmission owners and spin off could occur.  Federal assets (TVA, BPA, WAPA) are unlikely to be spun off for some time, if ever.
For-Profit-Gridco-Grade 8.5.  I see this as a slight variant from an ISO form.  Like the transco, independence arises from  corporate structure and regulatory restriction on activities.  However, I don't think it can take on much risk for delivery or congestion cost certainty.  The Gridco will be thinly capitalized in comparison to the cost of the transmission system or the value of energy transmitted.  As a result its efficiency over the not-for-profit ISO is some share of operational benefits.
Not-For-Profit ISO with Independent Board--Grade 8.0.   This is actually very close tie with the For-Profit Gridco.   The best form I have seen is that proposed for RTO West.  The members of the ISO (the customers and stakeholders) select a nominating committee representing each class of members.  The nominating committee selects a search firm to proposed candidates who meet the conflict of interest standard.  The nominating committee elects directors from the slate of candidates.  Every member of the nominating committee votes on every director.  A majority of the committee must agree to every director selected.  Directors must stand for reelection every three years, with staggered terms for the directors.  The Board of Directors is subject to open meeting requirements except for personnel matters.  An Advisory Committee is formed of the members,  but it is open to participation by all parties.  The Advisory Committee meets periodically by itself and with the board.  However, any party may submit its views to the board on any matter.  The Advisory Committee serves as a forum for discussion but it is not a gate keeper determining what the board should be told.  There is no voting class structure for the Advisory Committee because it does not make recommendations as a group.  Individual groups submit their views directly to the board.
Not-For-Profit ISO with Stakeholder Board--Grade 5.  This is a poor option, far below the Independent Board.  The first CA-ISO board showed it self to be largely paralyzed by the inability of the various stakeholders to vote for anything that would harm anyone.  As a result, in my view, they never really enforced the file tariff, e.g., forming new zones when it was clearly needed.  However, two worse forms exist.
Not-For-Profit ISO with State Appointed Board--Grade 2.1.  This is an even poorer outcome, since state politics will prevent the ISO from ever acting independently.  This kind of board will serve at the Governor's pleasure.  It will discriminate in the interests of a single state.  Even if the board were appointed by multiple governors, it would have no incentive to provide an efficient market.  To include multiple states, an interstate compact is needed with Congressional approval.  Similar organizations (Northwest Power Planning Council, Colorado River Commission, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, etc.) have slow reaction times and are political driven.
Not-For-Profit Transco--Grade 2.0.  Lacking an efficiency target imposed by a profit goal, a not-for-profit transco would tend to maximize the benefits for its own staff.  The management will want to extend the size of the enterprise to justify salaries and the staff will have few reasons to care about customer service.  This is the DMV.  This kind of agency will tend toward condescending, paternalistic approaches to its services, i.e., imposing the values of the staff on the response to any request for service.

Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance


November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  ""Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season,"" says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  ""Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions.""

""Transmission systems in North America are also expected to perform
reliably,"" he added, ""although some transmission congestion is expected
during the course of the winter.""  According to the report, fuel
supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this
winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20
percent greater than the same time last year.

The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe
drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from
hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are
sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's
demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a
combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is
expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.

For a copy of the 2001/2002 Winter Assessment, visit NERC's web site at
(http://www.nerc.com).  NERC's web site also includes information on the
electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to ""keep the lights on"" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

(May 21, 2001) With industrial production retrenching, capital spending  
dropping rapidly and layoffs by major corporations accelerating, the Fed went  
to the pump once again and opened the spigot wider in the hopes of reflating  
the economy as well as the stock market. Equity markets initially responded  
in a lackadaisical manner (indicating that the decrease was factored into the  
market) before surging higher the following day on higher volume...

PARTIAL OUTLINE OF FEATURED ARTICLES IN CURRENT ISSUE OF CONSENSUS FUTURES  
AND FINANCIAL WEEKLY:  
THE WALL STREET DIGEST by Donald H. Rowe 
(June 2001) The NASDAQ is up 35% since the April 4th bottom. The  
advance/decline line has been moving up relentlessly ever since the market  
bottomed. The stock market has never failed to move up aggressively after a  
third interest rate cut by the Fed. We have had four rate cuts and number  
five is already factored into the market. Analysts say a sixth rate cut on  
June 27th is possible... 
DB'S NEW U.S. MONETARY & CREDIT CONDITIONS AND THE DOLLAR by Deutsche Bank AG  
Foreign Exchange Research Department 
(May 25, 2001) The yen gained substantial ground on both the Euro and the  
dollar this past week despite widespread evidence of deteriorating Japanese  
economic data. Evidence of weakening fundamentals can be found on several  
fronts. For example, Japan's trade surplus narrowed a whopping 41.6% in  
April, the seventh straight month of double-digit declines in the trade  
surplus... 
U.S. SILVER SUMMARY--2000 by Silver Users Association 
(May 23, 2001) For the second consecutive year, the difference between the  
high and low prices for silver (H&H NY) was less than one dollar per ounce.  
The high for the year was set in February at $5.53 per ounce. The average  
monthly price also reached its highest level for the year at $5.30 in that  
month. For the remainder of the year there was a steady downward trend  
resulting in an average of $5.00 for the year, closing the Millennium on  
December 29 at $4.595 per ounce, the lowest daily price in 2000... 
FARMERS CAUGHT IN ENERGY SQUEEZE by Richard A. Brock & Associates, Inc. 
(May 18, 2001) The long-term energy package unveiled this week by the Bush  
administration contained numerous strategies to address what the White House  
calls an ""energy shortage."" The report from an energy task force says, ""A  
fundamental imbalance between supply and demand defines our nation's energy  
crisis. This imbalance, if allowed to continue, will inevitably undermine our  
economy, our standard of living and our national security""... 
MONEY MATTERS by Peter Dag & Associates, Inc. 
(May 14, 2001) Money matters. There is a strong effort on the part of many  
economists to downplay the importance of monetary aggregates. Even the Fed  
has convinced Congress not to hold them responsible for targeting monetary  
aggregates. The reason? It is difficult to define money because of the  
globalization (this is a word used to confuse people when one does not know  
what is going on) of the financial markets and continued financial  
innovation... 
SOYBEAN COMPLEX by Salomon Smith Barney 
(May 2001) We estimate the U.S. planted soybean area in 2001 at 77.0 million  
acres, about 350,000 acres above the March indications. Based on normal  
abandonment, we forecast the 2001 soybean harvested area to be 75.8 million  
acres, 3.1 million higher than last year. Predicated on our yield estimate of  
38.8 bushels per acre, we would then project the U.S. 2001 soybean crop at  
2.94 billion bushels, 170 million bushels higher than last year and slightly  
below the USDA's February estimate of 2.945 billion bushels...

Subject: Agreement to Upgrade and Operate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities



Dear Gerald:

In accordance with our conversation of yesterday regarding the Agreement
to Upgrade and Operate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (the ""Upgrade
Agreement"") I have reviewed the documents and investigated the location
of the metering station; the results are as follows:

* The existing sales contract provides quality and pressure
obligations.
* The existing sales contract provides for measurement of the gas.
* The existing sales contract provides for noncompliance with
quality obligations.
* As you indicated, the existing sales contract provides you have
no obligation to odorize the gas.
* The existing sales contract provides for the installation of
meters by Enron.  Part of the metering equipment was replaced under the
existing sales contract pursuant to an amendment (I will be pleased to
provide you a copy if you wish).
* The existing sales contract states that HTI is responsible for
all taxes except specifically excluded taxes; taxes measured by net
income are in the list of excluded taxes.
* The HPL Facilities are on property owned by HTI.  Accordingly,
company policy dictates that any subcontractor coming on HTI premises
must carry certain types of insurance that provides for certain
endorsements.  A sample provision is attached to this message.

On the basis of the meeting held in our offices on Monday with
representatives of your company, Niels Udengaard, our Vice President,
was under the impression that the Upgrade Agreement was no longer
required.  We are prepared to handle the matter in the manner formerly
used to replace metering equipment.

Please let me have your comments.

Sincerely,
Haldor Topsoe, Inc.

Kim -

You should probably hold off on the financial trading for now.  Santa Clara is a municipal entity, and until Legal has scrubbed them for authorization to trade financially, we can't do anything with them.  As you know, this is not a quick endeavor.

I can start working on a Master Physical right away, though.  Do you have updated financial info from them?

our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..

Marie, we do not have a Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  We do, however, have a Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd. dated September 19, 1999.  Attached is a copy of the agreement (I will fax the signed execution page to you):

 << File: reliant.master5.clean.final.doc >> 

With respect to Engage Energy Canada L.P., attached is the Amended and Restated Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement dated January 4, 2001 (I will fax the signed execution page to you):

 << File: Amended&Restated.Master(2000)-5.doc >> 

I will have to fax the Firm Gas Sales Contract (15-year Sithe Supply) Agreement (plus the Amendment) to you, as I can't seem to locate it on the system.  Stephanie Panus should have a copy of the ISDA Master Agreement with Engage.  Are you able to get it from her or would you just like me to fax our copy to you?  ISDAs are not on our system as they are generated in Houston.

With respect to Coral Energy Canada, Inc., I will be faxing to you the following documents:

	- Letter from Shell Canada Limited dated June 1, 1997 assigning certain agreements to Coral (see Schedule ""A"" attached to letter)
	- Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement to you (again, I can't seem to locate it on the system) dated January 3, 1995

298,"When was it recovered?  As cash?
Is there not a period of time this can be ""disputed""?  (I thought there was a six month period under Order 581)
Given the significant UAF on TW, why is this gain deemed real, while the others have not?

The UAF is at a gain so it has already been recovered.  TW was reserving against the possibility of an undefined future measurement adjustment from a shipper which would lower the previously recovered UAF gain.

In July 2001 TW had a UAF gain of 93,400 dt valued at $258,718.00 which will be recorded in August business.

As expected the UAF gain was reduced after the July 10 repair to the receipt value at the Williams interconnect.  In my opinion a reserve of the $258,718 July gain is not necessary since we currently have $4.3 million already set up and the lack of recourse available to Williams.  Please indicate managements wishes.

Debbie and I have just returned from the NNG/TW UAF meeting.  On TW, a leakey receipt value was repaired on July 10, 2001 at an interconnect with Williams Field Services.  This caused unmetered gas receipts to flow into TW and there does not appear to be any way to estimated Williams losses.  Starting in August we expect the UAF gains to disappear from TW.  If so, we recommend reversal of the UAF reserves at a time management feels appropriate.   

Until then, TW has another $1 million of UAF gains which we wish to reserve.'

Jeannie -- I don't know how far it is prudent to take a position on this as a 
co.  It has already become a key battleground (garnering some discussion in 
the Gore-Lieberman debate).  I think we stay away from it as a co., but we at 
least ought to put the information in front of anyone we are asking to do an 
oped so that they can make a reasoned judgement.

Hi -- I'm working on a dual gas/power op-ed (the former DeLay op-ed). I have 
Enron's message points on higher gas prices, but I wondered if we were taking 
a position on expanding natural gas exploration as Gov. Bush proposes -- onto 
more federal lands, particularly in Alaska. I read somewhere that 40% of 
potential US reserves are on federal lands.

Thanks for your help,
Jeannie
"
305,"I think there is still the possibility that, just like has happened to El Paso, that Enforcement could still open the case since FERC is still out trying to find a way to get us.   It is true that the ALJ did not help them out, but that decision is not binding upon the commission.    Neither Stan, Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win.  We are pleased with the ALJ decision, but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended.

Unlike your regulatory liabilities in the past - ""subject to refund"" - in
which there is an order from the FERC stating you can increase rates but
you need to reserve for them because they are subject to refund until the
final order comes out, this is a GAAP contingency and must meet the
definition of ""probable"" liability.  Does mangement really believe that it
is probable they will not be able to recover the $10 million?  Especially
given the 10/24/01 initial decision, do you really believe it is not
recoverable given the fact you've publicly stated that you are entitled to
it, the paying parties have stated you are entitled to it and now the ALJ
has stated that you are entitled to it?

Will management represent to us that it is probable TW will not be able to
recover in the general rep?

I'm not sure this qualifies as a subsequent event because it isn't
conclusive enough to trigger a reserve reversal. I think we should disclose
it in the interests of full disclosure, but certainly doesn't require a
change in financials.

     Subject:  RE: Initial Decision of ALJ in TW Negotiated Rates
             Proceeding


     I very much agree with the below and the reason for establishing the
     reserve, however, given the positive order from the ALJ is this a type
     I or
     type II subsequent event (one requires adjustment to the financial
     statements and one that does not).  I realize the FERC still needs to
     approve, however I think that the ""heat"" as described below has cooled
     down
     and a recommendation from the ALJ to the FERC would be viewed as a
     positive
     thing causing the need to reverse the reserve.  (see below literature
     from
     SAS 12).



     .02 Two types of subsequent events require consideration by management
     and
     evaluation by the independent auditor.

     .03 The first type consists of those events that provide additional
     evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the
     balance
     sheet and affect the estimates inherent in the process of preparing
     financial statements. All information that becomes available prior to
     the
     issuance of the financial statements should be used by management in
     its
     evaluation of the conditions on which the estimates were based. The
     financial statements should be adjusted for any changes in estimates
     resulting from the use of such evidence.

     .04 Identifying events that require adjustment of the financial
     statements
     under the criteria stated above calls for the exercise of judgment and
     knowledge of the facts and circumstances. For example, a loss on an
     uncollectible trade account receivable as a result of a customer's
     deteriorating financial condition leading to bankruptcy subsequent to
     the
     balance-sheet date would be indicative of conditions existing at the
     balance-sheet date, thereby calling for adjustment of the financial
     statements before their issuance. On the other hand, a similar loss
     resulting from a customer's major casualty such as a fire or flood
     subsequent to the balance-sheet date would not be indicative of
     conditions
     existing at the balance-sheet date and adjustment of the financial
     statements would not be appropriate. The settlement of litigation for
     an
     amount different from the liability recorded in the accounts would
     require
     adjustment of the financial statements if the events, such as personal
     injury or patent infringement, that gave rise to the litigation had
     taken
     place prior to the balance-sheet date.

     .05 The second type consists of those events that provide evidence
     with
     respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance
     sheet
     being reported on but arose subsequent to that date. These events
     should
     not result in adjustment of the financial statements.(superscript: 1)

     of these events, however, may be of such a nature that disclosure of
     them
     is required to keep the financial statements from being misleading.
     Occasionally such an event may be so significant that disclosure can
     best
     be made by supplementing the historical financial statements with pro
     forma
     financial data giving effect to the event as if it had occurred on the
     date
     of the balance sheet. It may be desirable to present pro forma
     statements,
     usually a balance sheet only, in columnar form on the face of the
     historical statements.

          (superscript: 1.)This paragraph is not intended to preclude
     giving
          effect in the balance sheet, with appropriate disclosure, to
     stock
          dividends or stock splits or reverse splits consummated after the
          balance-sheet date but before issuance of the financial
     statements.

     .06 Examples of events of the second type that require disclosure to
     the
     financial statements (but should not result in adjustment) are:

        a.      Sale of a bond or capital stock issue.

        b.      Purchase of a business.

        c.      Settlement of litigation when the event giving rise to the
     claim
          took place subsequent to the balance-sheet date.

        d.      Loss of plant or inventories as a result of fire or flood.

        e.      Losses on receivables resulting from conditions (such as a
          customer's major casualty) arising subsequent to the
     balance-sheet
          date.

     .07 Subsequent events affecting the realization of assets such as
     receivables and inventories or the settlement of estimated liabilities
     ordinarily will require adjustment of the financial statements (see
     paragraph .03 (Document link: P/AU560.03/AUPROSTD)) because such
     events
     typically represent the culmination of conditions that existed over a
     relatively long period of time. Subsequent events such as changes in
     the
     quoted market prices of securities ordinarily should not result in
     adjustment of the financial statements (see paragraph .05 (Document
     link:
     P/AU560.05/AUPROSTD)) because such changes typically reflect a
     concurrent
     evaluation of new conditions.

     Proceeding


     At the time the reserve (early '01) was eatablished, the CA situation
     was much much much more contentious, and likely recovery of amounts
     negotiated was -at that time- in jeopardy. Over the course of the year
     via much time and effort (legal, regulatory, commercial), and to a
     certain degree -stablization of the CA market, customers, and the FERC
     ALJ have seen their way clear to a reasonable position.

     I got Greg Porter's message too, however this doesn't tell me why the
     reserve was initially established in the first quarter - i.e. a
     probable
     liability.  In fact, this document seems more to weigh against your
     need
     to
     establish a liability.  Did I miss something?

You probably won't remember my name, but I am the Ph.D.  student that took 
you back to the airport after your visit to Louisiana State  University 
during the previous academic year.
?
I received my M.S. in Finance in May of last year, and chose  to?remain at 
LSU to work on my Ph.D. At that time, I intended to pursue a  career 
in?teaching and research at a four year college or university.?  In 
part?because of your visit,?and my?primary interest in  normative research, 
my?plans have changed.? While I?still want to  earn my Ph.D.,?I plan to 
pursue a career in research in the private  sector.
?
As you know, Ph.D. programs in financial economics are  designed to train 
future academics.? Not surprisingly, they emphasize  methods to approach the 
types of questions that are of interest to finance  academics.? What did 
surprise me, however, was that these areas of interest  often had little to 
do with what I imagined to be the concerns of practitioners  in the real 
world.? As you mentioned in your discussion, academic  researchers know 
little about what their counterparts in the private sector  
are?doing.?????????????????????????????????????  
?
In light of my objective, I feel I would get the most out of  the remainder 
of my doctoral studies if I took some time off to work in the  private sector 
to see first hand the?types of challenges I can expect to  face as a 
researcher in corporate America.? As my primary interests revolve  around the 
use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk  management, 
Enron, as the leading innovator in these areas, would be an ideal  place to 
learn.? I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the  company 
that might provide me with the exposure I am looking for.? If there  are no 
such positions or opportunities, any advice or suggestions you could give  
me,?such as whether or not you think such a ""sabbatical"" (for lack of a  
better term) would be helpful, or information on private sector careers for  
Ph.D.'s would be greatly appreciated.?

317,"
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

Subject: Comments on Judge Wagner's Proposed Recommendation  

As you may be aware, the Chief Judge informed the parties to the settlement 
proceeding this afternoon that he intends to recommend to the Commission that 
it employ the June 19 rate methodology for the refund period from October 2 
forward.

Attached are draft comments that Sarah Novosel and I propose to submit to the 
Judge and his legal staff tomorrow.  While we would like to convince the 
Judge that the June 19 methodology is not appropriate, we also provide a 
fallback approach.

Please review the comments (they are only 4 pages) and send your comments to 
us.  We plan to submit the comments tomorrow.

Thanks

Ray and Sarah

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Sarah Grisham

As we discussed, the following are my questions:

1. We need some verification that the debt that is referred to in the 
articles is the debt of Asia Pulp & Paper Co. Ltd. (""Asia Ltd.""), the entity 
referred to in the Confirm and that the amount that is the subject of the 
standstill is at least 10 million.

2. We need to confirm that the debt that is the subject of the standstill 
meets the following characteristics:

 - it is a bond or a loan 
- it ranks pari passu with other senior, unsecured debt of Asia Ltd.
 - it is not payable in the currency of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized
 - it is not governed by the law of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized

333,"Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the 
MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have 
been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.

A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V 
facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All 
Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.

Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air 
permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an 
endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted 
and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a 
new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered 
Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian 
Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the 
EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.  

Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to 
an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed 
project for Transwestern Pipeline Company.

Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th 
NFL meeting in MIdland.

342,"Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

347,"Below is a quick follow up to some of the things I mentioned I'd check out at our last meeting.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance with your efforts.

Contributions
The contributions from last year that I mentioned at the meeting turned out to be inclusive of Enron Corp., individual and matching funds.

Weather
I had a chance to talk with our folks from the Weather Group.  The information regarding Oklahoma that I told you I'd look into actually ended up being a center for Weather Research that was being sponsored by Williams not our weather group.

Scholarship
There are a couple of different scholarship and fundraising initiatives underway that are being driven by Enron employees and alumni of the individual universities employed here.  They take advantage of matching funds and are administered by employees here with some assistance by Community Relations and University Affairs.  If you are interested in organizing an effort like this for Oklahoma, let me know and I can work with you on the details.

350,"Dear Beta Bros,

     I fully intended to respond to Woody's e-mail and forward about
President Bush much more quickly than this.  I noticed that there was no
response out there when Woody posted this and I didn't want him to
feel so lonely, so here goes... (warning: this is not lighthearted fare!)
     I'm sure that life for all of us has changed to some extent since
September 11th.  That day was a vivid reminder that I don't have a choice in
determining how or when I'm going to die (barring suicide of course), but I
do have a choice about how I'm going to live.  September 11th and the events
which continue to unfold have caused me to focus a whole lot more on what's
truly important in life- family, relationships, faith.
     Believing that those terrorists were willing to die for a lie, I've
been forced to ask myself- what am I willing to sacrifice for what I believe
is the TRUTH?
     For many of you guys, I confess, I failed to personally share what I
believed was the truth, even back in college.  I was not willing to
sacrifice acceptance- a hard thing for a college kid to give up. Forgive me
for that.
     [Unbelievably, just after I wrote that last statement I was interrupted
by a telephone call from the father of a guy named Gary Vale who some of you
may have known. He was a football player and on my freshman floor at SMU.  I
wish I had room to tell you Gary's whole story.  In short, we were friends,
I watched him begin trashing his life in the Spring semester but failed to
try to help much.  Gary became an alcoholic, just sobering up three years
ago.  But, too late to recover from damage that had been done.  He walked
into my life again two months ago when, through a series of ""coincidences,""
he ended up at our church.  His father just called to tell me that Gary died
last night.  I can't help but wonder if this tragedy could have been avoided
had I done more in the Spring of '72? So, it's now with grief and an even
greater sense of urgency that I write this today.]
     If recent events have moved you to a place of searching and seeking,
please read on and allow me a few moments of your time to share what I've
experienced as real truth about real life.
     I've found the evidence to be very compelling that this planet and all
it contains (including us), is the design of a very imaginative Creator.
That Creator is not an impersonal force, or removed and simply ""watching us
from a distance."" He is a personal being who knows His creation and
desperately desires to be known by them.  He so much desires to be known by
us that, in a manner that will remain a mystery until we see Him face to
face, He became a man in the person of Jesus Christ.
     Some think perhaps Jesus was merely a great teacher or prophet.
However, I realized that in order to be intellectually honest I could not
accept that.  Jesus claimed to be God; and he claimed to hold the key to
people's eternal destiny.  Jesus'claims left only three options.  He was
either a liar (the worst kind because he deceived people about their
eternity), a lunatic, or, he was who he said he was- he was Lord.
     Could God love me that much, to go that far?  To allow His own Son to
come and show us and teach us what God is like? To die on a cross to pay the
penalty of my sin and obtain my forgiveness? To rise from the dead to secure
the opportunity to have a personal relationship with God both now and
forever?
     Personally, I've found all of the above to be true.  God is a personal
God.  Jesus is Lord.  And, God does love me that much- to suffer the death
of His own Son in order to offer real life (now and forever) to me and
anyone else who is willing to do just one thing...  receive that gift; just
accept Him.
     A number of years ago I did accept Him.  And, in doing that, I've
experienced everything He said to be true.  Life has not been problem-free.
That's not what He promised, in fact, Jesus assured us that we will have
problems in this life.  But, He has always personally been there. He has
always given His strength, wisdom, guidance, peace, contentment, patience,
encouragement, hope, and love. [These Scriptures tell about it: John 3:16,
Romans 5:8, Romans 6:23, Ephesians 2:8-9, 1 Corinthians 13, and many more]
     As Woody's e-mail stated, it is encouraging to know where this
President is turning at such a time as this.  Thank God that's a personal
relationship that's offered to anyone who seeks it, not just the big boys.
Thanks for giving me a few moments to share these thoughts.
      If you'd like to talk more about this, I'd love to do so.  My phone
number is 918-743-8897 (office), 918-298-6144 (home) and my e-mail addresses
are pastorhess@hotmail.com,or, hess@shbc-tulsa.org.  I wish I could be at
more of the gatherings, but weekends are a tough time to get away in this
business!  May God bless you all.

-kai-

Hess Hester

Alex will take care of this tonight.

Prices for the weekend look like:
onpeak $20.75

This doesnt look too good for the weekend run.    Let me know what you need to do.

Dear Stan,

Given the current state of affairs here in the D.C. office, I am forwarding my resume for your review.  The lion's share of my legal experience has been with Enron's regulated pipelines, both domestic and overseas.  I appreciate your keeping me in mind should needs or opportunities arise in the pipeline group, whether these be as an employee or on a contract basis.

Thanks for your consideration!  

Kindest regards,  Ray

354,"Lisa,

I decide to jot down some of my ideas for our eCommerce strategy.  For the 
most part, these are ""brainstorming fodder"".  Here goes:

Mindset:  If it can be sold, it can done via the Internet.
Mindset:  If it is currently done on a form, a forms-based electronic version 
should be created.
Provide our customers, operators with transaction preparation software which 
can be run on a desktop or notebook computer and a PDA.  Ensure that a 
synching mechanism allows for movement of the transaction to and from the 
PDA.  Use models such as MS Money for the PocketPC.  Give away this software 
and the pre-programmed PDA.
Allow feeding of the above transactions into an asynchronous process on our 
side.  This will help deal with unreliable connectivity.  Customers should be 
able to inspect the progress what is in our system.
Provide ""wireless snippets"" of our current applications.  This means 
extracting key decision points so that internal people or our customer can 
make them from anywhere.  For example, the customer would be able to confirm 
a pre-arranged capacity release deal.  Another example: contract request 
approvals could be moved to cell phones or PDAs.  This would speed our 
business processes.
Provide ""respondable"" notifications.  Internal people or our customer would 
subscribe to the types they wish to receive.  For example, a customer could 
be notified of a higher bid on a biddable capacity release offer and have the 
opportunity to bid higher via her cell phone or PDA.  Another example:  
support personnel could be notified of an unresponsive server and have the 
ability to initiate a reboot from her cell phone or PDA.
Base most or all of our Web pages on XML or provide an XML download (in 
addition to the current comma-delimited choice).  We should lead the way in 
identifying the necessary ""vocabularies"" for GISB data sets and data not 
currently defined by GISB.  This would permit the customer to move the data 
into any of several XML-capable tools such as spreadsheets, word processors 
and so on.  The more sophisticated customer may use the Web page address to 
extract data into their own custom apps.
Implement the supernom across ETS pipelines.
Is there an opportunity for us to overbook as do the airlines?
Expose some of our systems functionality via remote method calls using Simple 
Object Access Protocol (SOAP).  SOAP is based on the Internet standards of 
HTTP and XML and is, therefore, platform/ technology agnostic.  For example, 
we may allow the customer to obtain certain non-proprietary data base 
information such as name and legal descriptions of point locations, legal 
entity names, tax authorities, lat/long and so on.  We could get more 
adventurous by exposing such things as capacity currently not nominated ahead 
of the nom deadline.
Provide the customer the ability to assemble a contract electronically with 
pre-approved terms and conditions, locations and alternate locations, etc.
Provide annual usage statements to assist the customer with their planning.
Provide graphical displays of certain tabular data.  For example, we might 
show the customer actual versus nominated, nominated vs. MDQ, monthly usage 
charts, etc.
Consider where we could or should apply fees to some of the above services.

I believe I have a few more of these that I haven't yet extracted.  I hope 
these can be useful in today's session.

Terry

Randy,

Listed below are some companies/individuals we have used in the past to provide translation services.  The first two would be the preferred.

CD Language Solutions, 713-661-9553, email: languagesolutions@prodigy.net

mellis.sanford@enron.com (can't find her number); she teaches Spanish at Enron

interlingua - Muriel Dupont # 713-957-2040

Carlos Varela #281-646-9754 (phone and fax), email is:  cvarela7@yahoo.com

If you are interested in using one these options I suggest we get a price quote first.  Since these people are scattered about in Houston, they like to do things over email if files are electronically available.  If not, I recommend using a courier service - such as City Central at 713-623-0303 (never had a problem with them).

If you have any questions or need any additional information please let me know.

Ronnie;
Please have someone look at the CES purchase agreement to see how these 
should be handled.  I would assume that at a minimum, they would pay, 7/12ths 
of the bill since the deal was consummated on July 31.  There may be 
provisions where they bear all the taxes.

360,"Gerald. a couple of comments/questions:

1.  Why are there references to fixed volumes referenced (Section 1.6, 
Section 2.1)?  These contracts, I thought, were to be truly varaiable,swing, 
best efforts, interrruptible type contracts.

2. I need to understand the mechanism for determining the ""Variable""Services 
Fee.  It looks like to me that it is really fixed, based upon the underlying 
rate in the referenced gathering agreements.  Are those underlying rates 
variable or fixed?  It would be better from an accounting perspective not to 
have referenced contracts, but rather just have a market based, negotiated 
monthly and variable, transportation rate.

361,"Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward 
play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying 
would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the 
strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.  
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2 
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be 
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching, full 
liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric generation 
demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d 
greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out 
of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start really losing 
demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about recession in 
industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think 
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward 
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage 
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a month 
ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas 
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day y 
on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C 
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power 
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than heat. 
i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to 
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon and 
ill
keep you posted.

Industrial Markets (led by Bruce Garner in Europe and Jeff McMahon worldwide) is expecting significant growth this year.  

Jeff and Bruce expect that by year end, they will have approximately 45 commercial people in Europe and will need significant support for their efforts.

This is a very exciting new business area for us in Europe and we need to ensure that they have sufficient resource dedicated to help them in their efforts.  Could each of you sit down with Bruce and agree the resource which will be dedicated to his group.  As a base proposition, all resources should be sourced out of Europe and each group must have at least one person who is accountable to Bruce for support.  Costs will be re-charged in the normal way.

Please let Jeff and I know what is agreed and call me if there are any difficulties.

Thanks.

MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS
Patient but Not Passive
A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswomen. She is strong and resolute, but not in a hurry. 
Patricia Sellers
Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2001



For some 30 years--ever since women started jockeying for power in the workplace--patience has gotten a bad rap. After all, the virtue fairly reeks of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive wife and mother. So women have shunned it. Instead they have felt the need to make bold pronouncements and rush to action. That was never truer than during the season of dot-com mania, when every CEO professed to be leading a revolution. And any leader who failed to act quickly was supposed to get trampled by the capitalist vanguard. 

Now, in these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly. We're not talking about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or who sat passively in an out-of-the-way corner. Rather, they stayed with a company, steadily building influence there, and rose to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion. These qualities, of course, serve men as well as women. Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, argues that the most successful corporate turnarounds were led by such colorless men as Darwin Smith at Kimberly-Clark and William Allen at Boeing. Through a combination of deep knowledge of the corporation, personal humility, and will, they created enduring greatness. It's too early to say whether Anne Mulcahy, No. 6 on our list, can pull off such a feat. But she fits the profile. An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO, she felt ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July. ""I'm not as famous as Carly--and I want to keep it that way,"" says Mulcahy, 48. 

The famous Carly--Hewlett-Packard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorina--is still No. 1 on our list, as she has been every year since we began publishing the The Power 50 in 1998. She still heads the biggest company ($48.8 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move--a bold bet to buy competitor Compaq--but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. As a woman--and a daring, outspoken one at that--her actions are scrutinized more closely than the most driven of men. Says Fiorina: ""I've had a lot of male CEOs say to me, 'Thank God they don't rank us.' "" 

PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi (No. 10) understands the urge to take bold action, but she also knows the necessity of holding back. ""There is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a higher level--which is why women tend to push themselves harder than men,"" says Nooyi, 46. ""But we have to have the right people around who can say to us, 'You're draining the organization. You're pushing too hard.' "" Particularly now, as the U.S. prepares for an uncertain kind of war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn, power seems to call for pragmatic and careful leadership. 

This year's Power 50 is full of such steady leaders. Mulcahy, Nooyi, and the other corporate women who are new to the top ten this year--Mirant's Marce Fuller (No. 5), Pfizer's Karen Katen (No. 7), Chevron's Pat Woertz (No. 8), and Kraft's Betsy Holden (No. 9)--are all low-profile loyalists. The combined tenure at their current companies: 118 years. The six years Andrea Jung (No. 4) spent as head of marketing at Avon gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone expected when she became CEO two years ago (see It Took a Lady to Save Avon). 

As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: eBay's Meg Whitman, No. 2 on our list. Whitman, who at times took heat for not managing aggressively enough, has never overpromised investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter.

While the economy and its points of power change, the definition we use to evaluate power remains the same. We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career--where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list. She owns a product, The Oprah Winfrey Show, that generates more than $300 million in annual revenues and reaches 26 million viewers in the U.S. each week--plus millions more in 106 international markets. Her show, and now her magazine, O, The Oprah Magazine (whose subject is personal empowerment), have immense influence on the popular culture--from what books people read to what kind of lives they lead. 

The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers and three returnees from previous years. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. (Unless she wields media power like Martha Stewart, No. 13.) This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more. That's a first. The ranking has become so competitive, in fact, that some women moved down even though their power increased. Example: Shelly Lazarus. She heads a healthy business, ad giant Ogilvy & Mather (where, by the way, she has worked for 30 years), whose revenues grew 20% last year. Plus, she added a prestigious board seat--General Electric--to her resume. But in order to make room for newcomers, Lazarus slides to No. 11, from No. 7 last year. 

One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett (No. 20). Loyalty and self-knowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never imagined while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls, Vt. Barrett couldn't afford to go to a four-year college and had no specific ambition beyond believing she ""would be the best legal secretary in the world,"" she says. Barrett started as Herb Kelleher's secretary in 1967, a decade before he quit a Texas law practice to launch Southwest Airlines. She made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be America's top-performing airline. In her job as executive vice president of customers, she helped create Southwest's famously collegial culture and provided essential structure and discipline to Kelleher's grand vision. ""I've never wanted the CEO job,"" says Barrett. ""I don't think I have the talents for it. I'm a great No. 2 person."" Now 57, Barrett is exactly where she wants to be. 

Loyalty does not mean kowtowing. The women on our list push their companies to change and grow, and they take personal risks. ""Women have to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression,"" says Mirant CEO Marce Fuller. She should know. Fuller was getting great marks running international project development for Mirant's former parent, Southern, in 1994, when her boss asked her to take charge of the company's tiny North American power plant operations. After looking closely at the business, she told her boss she didn't want the job unless she could do something altogether new--build a high-tech risk-management and marketing organization to complement the expansion of power plants in the U.S. ""I told him, 'If you don't have this piece, you don't have a game plan,' "" she says. It wasn't an easy sell. Only 35 at the time, Fuller lobbied Southern's board for approval. Once she got it, she built a 600-person energy trading and marketing unit that is expected to generate $25 billion in revenues this year. Southern, a regulated utility, spun off Mirant last spring. So now Fuller is her own boss--and, with Mirant sure to be among America's largest companies this year, a FORTUNE 500 CEO. 

One of the few. The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of FORTUNE 500 companies, including Fuller. And there are fewer women in the pipeline than anyone would have thought 30 years ago. ""When I was 21, I was expecting that by this point we'd be in the fifty-fifty range,"" says Betsy Bernard (No. 23), CEO of AT&T Consumer. The reality, though disappointing, has motivated Bernard to become ""a catalyst, making sure that other women get opportunities."" Bernard, 46, and other women emerging now are not based on the old model--the shark-like Linda Wachner, whose company, Warnaco, crashed into bankruptcy this year. Or the flamboyant Jill Barad, who was booted from Mattel last year. Says PepsiCo's Indra Nooyi: ""PepsiCo, which used to be known for hiring 'Pepsi pretty'--blond, blue-eyed males--has made an Indian woman its president. That says a lot about the future of women."" Let's hope Nooyi is right. Meantime, if you don't see a new Wonder Woman in corporate America, it doesn't mean she doesn't exist. She might be quietly and diligently doing her job.

369,"I am working with Sarah to put into place an LC reimbursement facility which, 
among other things, will allow for the placement of lcs to support trading 
activities. I wanted to find out what requirements you were faced with in 
placing lcs -- prescribed forms of the lcs and timing in particular (i.e., 
how much time is available after demand for Enron to place the lc, and 
whether physical delivery was required to meet such request, as well as how 
business days was defined in your respective documents). As with all things 
Enron, time is of the essence. Thanks, JNE

The EWS West Power URM desk will need to determine the $$ at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response.  It's their $$.  So far, my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations (as outlined in the Mike Smith memo) are the ""preferred"" outcome - I'll reconfirm.

We could not do that.  On the other hand, if we advocate that it should only apply to those who directly benefitted, and the CPUC adopts that reasoning, we would be shooting our tax argument in the foot.  I think you are right that we need to understand the implications, both financially and contractually, of the options before the Commission.

Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.

From: 	Williams, Robert C.

To:	Sharp, Vicki
Subject:	$.01 surcharge as ""tax""

A typical clause reads as follows:

"" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include ""any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges""], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates.""

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes ""applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point"" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes ""applicable prior to the Delivery Point.""  The surcharge would seem to be applicable ""at the Delivery Point.""

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a ""tax"" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a ""rate increase""

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a ""tax"" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the ""frozen tariff"" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a ""rate increase""

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of ""taxes"" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and I have been working from a report provided by Russell Diamond that lists ""live"" deals for counterparties and our current exposure.  Based on that list, here are some deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books.  There will be many more deals listed to move on Tuesday.  Please note that deals for many of the counterparties listed on Russell's report have already been moved into the bankruptcy books due to auto-termination.

Once we finish looking at the ""live"" counterparties, we will continue providing deal information for new contracts that are added to the Master Log report compiled by Legal.  I will be adding the deals from Cyndie's sheets on Tuesday.  I have 8 more counterparties to review from Russell's report and that information will be provided on Tuesday as well.

373,"

I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the directive, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in October of $1.2 million.  

Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.

far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and 
commodities in the deregulating energy industry cannot be met with current

I would like to discuss with Gregg Penman (General Manager, enovate) the shift of responsibilities to you and determine if agreement changes to be made.  Additionally, if Enron determines this is the right move, we will need to meet with Peoples to usher in the change.

Thanx for your consideration in contemplating the effect on the customer in the Enron shift of people/responsibilities.  Please let Gregg assist you in this change.

Laura,
Vlady has requested that I take over the CRO function for Enovate.  I'm thinking about traveling to Chicago next week to review related market risk issues, and get a feel for any other risk issues.  Additionally, what do you think about getting together with some of the People's people?    Any other suggestions or ideas to add/take off my agenda?

379,"I am so glad that you will be able to attend.  I will have a fully developed 
draft agenda available within the next couple of days.  It may help to know 
that the plans for Sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 5:00 at the 
hotel, followed by dinner at the hotel at 7:00.  We hope to have Mark Frevert 
join us that night to informally address the group.  Sunday night will be 
low-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to 
Houston.  On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so 
that some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.  I 
do believe that some will stay Tuesday night and will plan to have meetings 
in the Houston office on Wednesday.  If that is the case, I will also arrange 
a dinner for Tuesday night.  Hope that this helps!

Subject: Joskow Paper on Industry Restructuring



Here's Paul Joskow's paper from the AEI/Brookings conference today.  Given
his stature in the industry, I think the quote on page 104 may be useful.

""I do not believe that in the long run the U.S. electric power sector can
exist and prosper with a checkerboard of competitive and non-competitive
states taking power from the same transmission networks, or even with a
large number of competitive states which have adopted a wide array of
different rules and institutions for wholesale and retail competition.""

Cheers.

386,"Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000

Below is the response that we received from our Agent.  Please call me at
(2120 902-1930 with any questions that you may have.


This has reference to our telecon. Enclosed is the relevant RBI regulation
for the captioned company (ABC) to sell its stake in the local company. To
effect the sale, ABC would require an approval from Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) even though the stock is listed. The documentation required varies
depending on whether the stock is thinly traded or actively traded. RBI's
definition of thinly traded is included in the regulation.

The company is required to fill out Form TS1 (I  am enclosing the format)
and submit this to RBI. In addition, the RBI requires certain documents
which are detailed in the form itself.

Trust this helps. Any other information that you require, please do not
hesitate to get in touch.

Enclosed please find redlined and clean copies of the versions of Executive 
Summary and Policies and Procedure that we plan on posting on LegalOnline.  
The most recent revisions reflect the newly announced Enron Wholesale 
Services organizational structure.  There are still a few unanswered 
questions relating to the EWS structure -- such as whether EWS will be an 
actual entity or simply an unincorporated ""umbrella"" of certain businesses.  
In large part, the revisions are simply more flexible versions of old 
language in light of these unanswered questions.  I would not say that any of 
the revisions amount to substantive changes to the policy.

Please contact me with any comments or questions you may have regarding the 
enclosed; however, please also keep in mind that we are on a very critical 
path towards the scheduled roll-out of LegalOnline.  In that regard, it would 
be greatly appreciated if any requested revisions could be made no later than 
Wednesday, Nov. 29.  Thanks -- Bob

Subject: Green Card

Jane,

When the Green Card Task Force was alive, we discussed a payback provision if 
the person left within two years after receiving a green card (voluntarily).  
Is this being done?  If not, I think we should talk about it, given all the 
time, energy, resources, funds, etc., being expended on getting a person a 
green card.

390,"I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127

improves the outlook for PG&E by > $2.00/MWH, mainly as a result of lower 
cost estimates for their hydro.  SCE's numbers remains about the same.  FYI, 
the prices in the model are at mid.  The switch to change to offer is now on

All,

I have meetings scheduled with most of you for Monday, and for those of you I don't I would really appreciate getting 1/2 hour to go through next steps with following the Voluntary Redundancy Programme. Rachel will call you.

Please find attached the following information I need to talk you through:


Bu Briefing Document. ( Clearly we need to make sure we are consistent across the Organisation )

 

Q&A Crib Sheet.

 
Draft Timeline.

 

Selection Criteria.  As you know it is imperative from a legal perspective that we document fully our selection criteria for both voluntary and if necessary, compulsory redundancy and our assessment of employees against those criteria . This information will be vital if we have to defend a claim on the basis of the fairness of our selection process.   

 

Finally for those who have remote offices, we need to decide a plan of action / timelines / legal implications etc.  Please note, these documents are still subject to final approval so I will bring any amendments when I see you.

Monday is going to be hectic, so if you need me call my mobile on 07818 077104.

Regards

Sophie

Subject: RE: Practice Sunday at 1 


Hi Jake and the rest of you,

I went there too (33rd and Powell) and found that no one was there.
Beautiful open field, nets and no one to kick it around with.  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at 1.  I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brad's team would be there.  Not sure what
happened I guess Brad's Team either took the week off,  moved, or changed
times. If any one sees him ask what is going on. I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service. I also went over to
Madison High on 58th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either.    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e-mail regarding practice.  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night 6 to 8 at Oregon Episcopal School
(OES) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks.  Is that still ok Justin or Adam?   Let us know.  Sorry about the no
show practice I'll try and sort it out.  Take care.

Jon

Green Roomers,

Declan has informed me of the following info...

""Brad said that Biddys have a practice game every Sunday at 1pm at the high
school
just off 30th and Powell (Cleveland High I think).  They would like us to
practice with them each week.""

Let's plan on fielding a team each Sunday at 1:00 to play the old Biddy's
team.   Should be a good way to stay in shape and organized as a team. Hope
to see you there on Sunday and if any other news comes up I will drop you a

Green Roomies,

We are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the 1st division. In first
division we'll have our work cut out for us but I think we'll do fine and
have fun.  The first game is Sept. 9th at 12:00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,
Adam, Scott, Jon B., Mike B., Jay, Justin, Declan, Tristan, and Jacob.  The
rest of you still need to mail $50 to Jon Gail 8573 SW Dakota Drive,
Tualatin OR 97062 if you want to play.  Again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions.  Later,

Jon Gail, Manager

"
405,"Bill -

If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me 
like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the 
confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.  
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the 
power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in 
Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on 
it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's 
concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer 
has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is 
that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer 
until they are correctly completed.

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to 
transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application 
they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it 
if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with 
changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

Mark

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like ""Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc.""  
or ""Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division"".

409,"Steve: 

Mike Terraso asked me to send you some information relating to the timing and the potential process of the Clean Water Act Section 308 information request sent from EPA Washington to Enron Corp. As Mike likely mentioned, the request seeks information regarding ""discharges"" and ""releases"" of ""oil"" from pipeline facilities since July 1998. Although the information request was addressed to Enron Corp., we believe the EPA's focus should be on the EOTT pipeline system. We shared these and other thoughts with the agency when we met last week in Washington D.C. We hope to hear back from EPA soon regarding clarification/resolution of several issues discussed during the meeting (e.g., whether a response solely from EOTT is sufficient at this time).  

TIMING -- Enron Corp. received the information request on July 7, 2001. We requested and received a 90-day extension from the agency, thereby making our response due on November 7, 2001. The agency likely will require a considerable amount of time to review our response because we will report a fairly significant number of discharges/releases, which will be accompanied by a large number of responsive documents. It is unlikely that the agency will begin a serious review of our response until sometime following the 2001 holiday season. Based on our meeting in Washington, we do not expect a quick response in 2002 because the Water Enforcement Division has an extremely busy agenda and a small staff, which likely will preclude them from focusing solely on our response. In addition, we know that the agency sent out a similar information request to the Williams Companies. Thus, we do not expect a response from EPA until late spring-mid summer of 2002 at the earliest.

PROCESS -- After we submit our response to the information request, EPA could respond in several ways:

(1) The agency could request a meeting to discuss the materials submitted on November 7, 2001 or send out another request seeking additional information. We will be prepared to respond to any such request. (This is a fairly likely scenario)

(2) Either before or after requesting additional information, EPA could issue a notice of violation and begin some type of administrative enforcement action. This could take the form of a compliance order and administrative civil penalty (all internal to the agency) or a consent decree with an order entered by a federal court. An order could include a fine, required pipeline maintenance activities, and/or stipulated penalties for future discharges or releases. Although the differences with our situation appear to be significant, EPA recently settled an enforcement action with Koch Industries for oil spills from its pipeline system for $30 million. Under an enforcement action, we would attempt to negotiate the terms of the order with the agency and hopefully minimize the size of any proposed fine. We also believe that our actions (principally those of ETS as operator of the EOTT pipeline system) between now and the time of the agency's response will be helpful in attempting to mitigate any fine or course of action proposed by the agency. (This is also a fairly likely scenario)

(3) If our response is particularly troublesome to EPA, the agency could turn the matter over to the Department of Justice. Before this scenario would unfold; however, the agency likely would conduct additional inquiries (e.g., more focused information requests and employee interviews). This scenario would be most problematic because it likely would unfold only if the government (EPA and DOJ) consider the alleged violations extremely serious and possibly systematic. (Although possible, this is a less likely scenario)

If you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to contact me (3-7267).

Audrey,

I think it may be appropriate to schedule a meeting with BCCK again.  Review
of schedule, compression bids, equipment purchase orders.  I thought we
would have lots of stuff on order by now.

Also, I can't remember if I discussed with you - I would like to develop
with your and Gerald's assistance a third party gas processing agreement for
the BWGP.  May need within the next 2-3 weeks to signup Lone Mountain.

Let's discuss.

FYI - Lots of rhetoric from the politicians about price gouging.  However, 
the article gives the impression that the FERC commissioners are leaning 
toward market structure reforms.

Lawmakers, Advocates Call for Repair of California'S Electricity Deregulation
Kate Berry , The Orange County Register, Calif.

( September 13, 2000 )



Sep. 13--Outraged politicians and consumer advocates demanded at a public 
hearing Tuesday that federal energy regulators fix California's flawed 
experiment with deregulation by cutting electricity prices and refunding 
consumers in San Diego and south Orange County for the high cost of power 
this summer.

Federal authorities on a day-long fact-finding mission said they plan to act 
quickly without backing away from the long-term goal of a competitive 
free-market for electricity.

""There are flaws in the existing power structure that I think must be 
repaired,"" said Linda K. Braithitt, one of four commissioners at the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, which launched a formal investigation last 
month into the politically disastrous rise in electricity prices in 
California.

More than 30 major players in California's electricity market, from utilities 
to power producers to state-run agencies that manage the electric grid and 
market exchange, offered various solutions to the crisis. The only consensus: 
Customers are paying exorbitant prices.

""We must roll back wholesale prices retroactively and refund consumers,"" said 
Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, who accused power producers of manipulating the 
power market and pushing retail prices higher.

He also called power producers ""criminals,"" reiterating a statement he made 
Sunday at a House commerce subcommittee hearing in San Diego.

""We know these prices are unlawful. I believe these prices are criminal."" 
Under the Federal Powers Act, regulators can intervene to limit the prices 
power generators charge if they determine the market is not workably 
competitive. FERC also has the authority to retroactively declare that 
market-based rates this summer were not ""just and reasonable."" If it does so, 
the PUC can act to require utilities to refund customers. The utilities then 
would likely go to the courts on the matter, Wood said.

The FERC investigation comes as electric bills for 1.2 million customers of 
San Diego Gas & Electric have more than doubled or quadrupled in some cases 
leading to hardship particularly for low-income residents and the elderly. 
Currently, the two biggest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern 
California Edison, have absorbed $2 billion in costs that they want to pass 
on to their consumers when a rate freeze ends in April 2002.

State regulators, which gave up control of wholesale prices when the market 
was deregulated in 1998, told their federal equivalents that the system is 
broken.

""It's time to reset the starting point back to protecting consumers until we 
can get it right,"" said Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission. ""We have not collectively, on the state and federal 
level, demonstrated a path that works."" Carl Wood, a commissioner at the 
California Public Utilities Commission, implored FERC to return, in the 
short-term, to a cost-based rate structure known to consumers before the 
utilities sold their power plants and had to purchase electricity on the 
power exchange. ""No competitive market exists,"" he said. ""The market isn't 
functioning in California right now."" William Massey, a FERC commissioner, 
admitted that California's market is flawed. He also said a return to a 
cost-based rate structure remained ""on the table."" But Curtis R. Hebert, 
another FERC commissioner, said the agency had to be cautious about further 
regulation. He advocates lifting price caps, changing rules on how suppliers 
buy and sell into the Power Exchange and adopting market-based approaches, 
such as having the utilities hedge with long-term contracts.

""You can't just say go back to cost-based,"" he said. ""It's not that simple."" 
The most heated discussion came when Michael Shames, executive director of 
UCAN, Utility Consumers Action Network, said FERC was ""on trial"" and could 
lose its case for deregulation.

FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker, said it was natural to look for blame on the 
part of power generators. But he added that ""making a lot of money gets a bad 
rap when individual electricity consumers are hurting."" He also asked a panel 
of power producers directly to ask why they were ""gaming the system."" ""We 
feel we've conducted business not only legally, but ethically,"" said Bill 
Hall, managing director of commercial affairs at Duke Energy, which owns 4 
percent of power generation in the state. ""We don't anticipate to make 
profits like this as soon as supply keeps up with demand."" John Stout, vice 
president of the Southwest region for Reliant Energy, said he was certainly 
in business ""to make a profit."" ""The fact that we had a good year in 
California, in terms of revenue, is a fact, I don't deny that at all,"" he 
said.

Across the street from the government building where the hearing was held, 
San Diego residents at a hair salon talked about the electricity crisis, with 
some residents in a retirement home paying $100 a month for electricity.

Pat Benites, manager of the C Street Salon, said the high-rise building she 
works in has seen its rates rise $116,000 a month this summer. ""They're just 
bilking us,"" she said.

""They told the whole building to turn computers off at night and turn 
electricity off,"" she said. It's dark in the lobby but we have to leave some 
lights on for protection, just so no one breaks in.""

415,"There are two correlation calculators that are now available in O:\Research\Custom\CorrelMatrix\.

CorrelAnalysis.xls can basket up to 3 curves and calculates the correlation matrix on contracts with different expirations.  This is particularly helpful when the correlation matrix is needed for NYMEX+basis+index calculations.

CorrelVolCalc.xls calculates the correlation between two baskets.  It can basket up to 3 curves in each basket, so this calculator is also able to handle NYMEX+basis+index calculations.

These calculators have been reviewed by the Research Group, and we feel that they are accurate.  Please let me (x53240) or Paulo Issler (x56274) know if you find any problems or have any questions about these new tools.

I will send you and McCabe my resume today.  I look foward to coming up to Cincy Wednesday to talk to you guys about these opportunities.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

John-
Further to our discussion regarding participation on behalf of Idaho Power in the FERC dockets (EL00-95-031, et al), after their call to me this weekend.  Their interest focuses on sales into and purchases from the ISO and the PX, substantial portions of which remain unpaid.  The sales at issue are not from their own generation but are as a marketer.  Idaho expects to assert that marketer sales must take into account more than the simple price of procurement, but also associated costs and a margin.  Conditions that enhance the creditworthiness of purchasers also are likely to be on Idaho's agenda.  The foregoing is provided solely to assure that Enron will not interpose any objection to our role on behalf of Idaho.  I attended the morning session of the settlement conference before Judge Wagner as an observer, pending completion of our formal procedures.  Bear in mind that Dan Watkiss of Bracewell & Patterson appeared on behalf of the involved Enron subsidiaries.  Understandably Idaho would like our position confirmed at the earliest possible time, as they already had to release their traditional FERC counsel.

In stark contrast to last winter's exceptional strength, spot distillate-to-
crude price differentials in Atlantic Basin markets are likely to stay weak:

Demand is down relative to a year ago, resulting from declining air travel, 
mild temperatures in North America, and much lower North American natural gas 
prices.

* Inventory levels are comfortable, with primary inventories in the United 
States and consumer stocks in Germany particularly high.

* Market psychology is preoccupied with the weak economy and downside risks, 
whereas a year ago a psychology of shortage prevailed in energy markets.

		 Subject: Re: Cash Collateral


Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Chris Garrod

Subject: Nat Gas - Big Picture recent updates
Friday August 10th marked at  the very least - Momentum Bear Market Low 
 
So,  the actual low came in a day earlier than  anticipated and about 15-17 cents above the 2.75-2.77 target. Check the intraday  out that suggested a rally would unfold following theFriday August 10th low.  
 
Sure enough, natural gas rallied over 20% the  following week. This may be no more than a short covering rally, as double  bottoms are always to be viewed with suspiciously. Thus far, in the month of  August, natural gas has taken out both the July lows and the July highs forming  an outside bar on the month. Will need to monitor the 2nd qtr close of 2001  closely to gauge whether the July and August double bottom is going to hold or  not. At the very least, the double bottom makes a  fantastic momentum low,  if not the actual intermediate bear market price low. 
 
                                         Setting up for an August 27th Three Year Anniversary Low  
 
Lo and behold, Friday August 10 did indeed turn out  to be no more than a Momentum Bear Market Low.  As usual, double bottoms  and tops always make good candidates for failure. But boy what a short covering  rally that was, good for 20% plus in couple of days. In any event, the update to  the monthly chart shows support in the 240-280 zone. Ideally, the bottom will be  seen at or above the November 1990 high at 2.65.  The 85 minute intraday  chart shows an expanding formation setting up a 4 point buy. Noteworthy is the  1.41 ratio at 263.5 that ties in so well with the old 1990 high at 2.65. Of  course downside momentum is strong enough to hammer into the 250's but it would  surprise to see such strong follow through to the downside momentum during the  week of August 27th.  
 
One reason to anticipate downside momentum will  subside next week is a time cycle. Intriguingly, the 3rd step down from the Dec  2000 high will equal the 1st step down in time on Monday August 27th.  And  that time symmetry would be ideal as it ties in so well with the 3 year  anniversary low that began that bull campaign to the Dec 2000 high in the first  place.

Eva,
;
Is this the story that we were previously contacted about by the NRC?

I have not read it in detail but it clearly fingers (part) of the blame at 
""producers"" withholding capacity including some such as Enron! which 
supposedly purchased old capacity (I am not aware that we did).
;
I am concerned about this story on 2 levels :-

1. It contains factual errors but suggests that lessons should be learnt by 
Dutch regulators to avoid problem ie could lead to anti-liberalisation 
backlash;and re-regulation (eg bring back the Protocol!).; 
2. We, along with other; market parties, are currently encouraging 
authorities in NL to tackle market power of the producers ie Electrabel, 
Reliant etc.; Surprisingly, Reliant is NOT mentioned in respect of California 
price spikes but Enron is.; Whilst not a directly comparable situation, the 
question over whether or not certain players have abused;market power;is 
common.; I do not want Enron;""tarred with the wrong brush"" in these 
discussions, especially since Reliant (which is a producer in California!) is 
getting away with it in NL!

Obviously, we do not want necessarilly want to stir up the hornet's nest on 
this BUT also do not want incorrect statements; especially;about Enron and 
California and especially where these can undermine our credibility/infleunce 
in Netherlands.; Hence, should we ask NRC to correct...
;
Lets discuss.

Folks:

I'd like to get everyone together for a closing dinner around the 1st of 
March or so to commemorate the closing of the Intergen LM6000 deal. Other 
people I'd like to invite include: Kevin Presto, Janet Dietrich, Lee Johnson, 
Carolyn Campbell, John Keffer, George Kuchbach (sp?), John Jones, Doug 
Pedigo, and Chris Colbert. We can also use this as an opportunity to talk to 
Intergen about other transaction opportunities. Any thoughts on whether we 
should invite the Coral folks?

 Please let me know your availability, and of any restaurant recommendations.

Thanks,


Ben

452,"The final decision added an average rate cap for industrial users.  It has 
the effect of lowering rates slightly.  Also, direct access remains exempt 
from the surcharge but language is added to ensure that DA Customers receive 
no bill credit.  The decision also adds the notion that the CPUC will now 
look at redesigning the credit system to ""reflect current structural reality.""

453,"I have a few questions regarding the transition. 

Access Programmers - the contractors will be managed by the end-users they 
are supporting from now on.  The budget dollars for them are in CC 103849 - 
$50K per month.  Do you want each department to continue paying their 
invoices against these budget dollars in 103849 or through their own cost 
centers ?  Do we transfer budget dollars? Close the cost center?  

Equipment - We have 1 flat screen and several large monitors.  Should we just 
return all equipment to surplus or offer to others?

Space - Will CommodityLogic be moving and assuming the space that will be 
vacated on 3/12?

Fax machine will be disconnected/returned.  Digital Scanner will be surplused.

There are two printers that can be surplused unless someone else (CL?) 
wants/needs them.  TurkeyLegs and Tarzan.  

I currently charge 50% of my time to CL and 50% to my cost center - 103850.  
Should I continue this or charge all my time to CL and close my cost center 
?  Since Marvia is also be redeployed, there is no one else in my cost center.

Let me know if you want to sit down and discuss or you can just provide quick 
answers here or in voice mail.

456,"Ken - 

Good morning.  

As a follow up to the voice mail that I left for you, following are some 
background and preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between 
Chancellor Reed and yourself.  Communications and indications from the UC/CSU 
team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with 
him on February 2, 2001.  As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting 
on Tuesday, 2/20/01, all things are moving along well in California with our 
clients, PG&E and SCE.  The current exception to the ""smooth sailing"" is 
UC/CSU.  Tom Riley, the account manager for UC/CSU, has prepared the 
following outline of business concerns, sequence of events and suggested 
talking points.

Ken, thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this 
client.

Regards - Dan



******************************************************************************
*********************
Business Concerns

UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enron's action to De-DASR their 
accounts.  They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that 
would allow us to address them, but I have been able to surmise that they 
consist of the following:

1.  UC/CSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access 
customer.  AB-1X, recently signed by Gov. Davis, has ban language preventing 
large commercial/industrial customers from going Direct Access.  Per Jeff 
Dasovich of Enron Gov. Affairs, it is not clear, but possible, that if we had 
not De-DASRed the accounts, that UC/CSU might have been grandfathered as a 
direct access customer.  Further, SB-27X (still pending), which is Senator 
Bowen's attempt to reverse the ban language of AB-1X, may have a financial 
ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status.  
Dasovich is investigating further.

2.  UC and CSU bought approximately 130 meters from Enron as we implemented 
the contract.  Our action is forcing the utility to remove these 
University-owned meters, meaning that their meters will become useless.  We 
are currently using those meters to provide daily 15 minute interval data as 
required in our contract. (Our operations and billing group have come up with 
a transition plan that SCE has agreed to. SCE would install dual-sockets 
allowing for the installation of the SCE meter, while keeping our meter in 
tact, mitigating their concern.  At this point, UC and CSU are not listening 
to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this 
solution).

3.  We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling 
coordinator (SC).  As a result of our action, we are no longer their SC.  
They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their 
recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program.



Sequence of Events

February 1 - I informed the UC/CSU electricity oversight board leaders and 
contract administrators of Enron's decision.  I walked through the power 
point presentation.  They expressed no concerns at that point, and even 
expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract.  I sent the UC and 
CSU contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our 
decision.

February 2 - Ken Lay called Chancellor Reed assuring the Chancellor that we 
will honor the contract.  I have since heard that this call was extremely 
well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and 
Ken's assurances that were communicated.  We offered the call to the UC 
President as well, but were channeled to his SVP.  By the time I made contact 
with the SVPs administrator, we had begun receiving letters (below), so I 
backed off on arranging the call.

February 5 - UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been 
speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications.  
Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their 
questions.  

February 8/9 - UC and CSU send letters to their PG&E and SCE account managers 
advising them they have concerns regarding Enron's decision, and that they 
(PG&E and SCE) should only De-DASR on the Universities' request.

February 12 - I received a letter from the UC/CSU contract administers asking 
for clarifications regarding our action, and requesting we re-DASR their 
accounts.

February 14 - I responded with a letter providing them with responses to 
their clarification questions, but did not offer to re-DASR their accounts as 
they had requested.

February 16 - UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their 
request to re-DASR and indicated they would be sending another letter.  I 
suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses.

February 20 - CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending 
outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay.

Throughout the entire process, I have been asking that the business 
administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns.  I gather CSU 
would like to do this, however, UC is more inclined to write letters and seek 
legal remedies.



Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome


1.  We were faced with a difficult business decision, and made our California 
decision with our customers in mind.  We have kept our contracts in tact.  
Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers.

2.  We are an energy outsourcing company.  We should source supply from the 
""best available"" source in the marketplace. We feel we have a contractual 
right to have made the decision.

3.  Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business 
administrators to listen to and address their concerns.  We have not been 
afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered.  However, the 
Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to re-DASR their accounts 
in the meantime.



I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired.  I can be reached at 
925-543-3703 (office), or 925-548-0326 (mobile) if you have any questions.

Regards, Tom

463,"As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you. 

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

		 Subject: $2.15 bn Enron Metals Inventory Financings Closed

Last Tuesday Global Finance Europe closed  a new off balance sheet facility 
with Barclays creating up to $1bn of capacity for existing and new physical 
metals trades for Enron Metals.  This transaction will be added to through an 
additional $350mm of capacity from Credit Lyonnais and compliments the $750mm 
Warrants structure completed in September. 

Each transaction involves a sale of either Physical Metal or Warrants to the 
bank with Enron receiving an associated call option. The bank hedges its 
market risk through a  complimentary foward sale with the LME. The new 
physical metal facility will start receiving its first trades this week.     

The transaction achieves much for Enron: 
Deconsolidation of approximately $2bn of debt financed inventory which came 
with the aquisition of MG plc;
The creation of new capacity to grow the business beyond its existing base; 
Committed facilities for the business unit which are at a lower cost  than 
the original debt financed facilities;  
The creation of an additional  $2.15 bn capacity in the bank markets as the 
facilities extinguish up to 20 lines of existing credit in the banks market; 
A clearer reporting and control structure for the funding of Enron Metals.; 
A repeatable low cost structure which meets all tax and accounting tests for 
applications across all our business lines    

Congratulations to the deal team on this great effort

excellent ruse!  We heard about this through other brokers who heard it from 
a counterparty.  However I tried the same for ICAPonline and 
intercapitalonline after Derek joked with them that we'd done it for all the 
other brokers, and they had no sites.  I wonder if they'll reserve the sites 
for themselves now that their minds have been focused, if you were thinking 
of doing the same for other brokers names, we should get moving.

Hope Houston's treating you well,

Louis

474,"Hi,
My name is Kevin Jackson and I had an idea while at the Body shop today.  Would it be possible to propose that Enron operate as a subsidiary of Dynegy, with the option to become an independent company after two years?  Without understanding the details of the merger conversations and options, it is my feeling that this could be beneficial for both companies.  Enron would obtain the cash infusion that it need, maintaining the culture and pulse of what makes us leaders; and Dynegy would retain its stock value and increase its bottom line profitability by having Enron as a substantial asset to its overall business portfolio.

We as employees of Enron are here because we are proud of a culture that sets us apart from any other company in the world.  Regardless of what is going on around us, we can still stand proud of what we have accomplished and the great talent pool we have here.  I know times are tough for you now as it is for us all, but we will survive and I support and trust your vision that made us a great company.

Thanks and I am interested in your feedback.

Regards,

Kevin Jackson

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

485,"Lon, thanks for including me on the following distribution.  Both Greek Rice 
and I have received phone calls from the Coastal (Great Lakes) corporate 
legal officer informing us of the outcome on the day of the decision.  He 
expects the State to appeal, and we will be watching this very closely.

We have had a series of meetings with the Minn DOR on behalf of NNG, 
discussing not only the compressor fuel issue but the Industrial Processing 
tactic in general, and were on hold by the DOR until this case with Great 
Lakes was decided.  

If you would like to have further details, please let me know and we will be 
gald to furnish them to you.

Thanks again.

As you may recall we have been arguing with the MN Dept. of Revenue for years 
over whether or not natural gas used as a compressor fuel was subject to the 
Minnesota use tax.  Great Lakes has been in court with the DOR over this same 
issue.  Today I received the following, which is an internal memo that was 
circulated in the Dorsey & Whitney law firm, which has been representing 
Great Lakes announcing a favorable ruling.

Subject: MTBE legislation

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer ""transition assistance""

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the ""transition assistance"" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a ""placeholder"" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a ""date certain"" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Hello to the Direct Access Coalition:

Below you will find a summary of the press strategy that Edelman Public
Relations intends to employ over the coming weeks in collaboration with the
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and the broader Direct Access Coalition.
I will also outline the information that I need from Direct Access Coalition
members who are willing to be involved in media outreach and interviews.
And finally, I have attached supporting documents that you can use as
background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that
you may receive.

This Week

1.   We are drafting a ""pitch letter"" to send out by the end of this week
via blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corps
reporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)
trade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Our
pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&I
customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are
suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will
address the effect on California's future business climate if direct access
is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x
caused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no
matter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a
part of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate
California businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a
prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.

2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access
Coalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press
strategy outlined here.

3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to
take media calls on behalf of the coalition.

Next Week

1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.

2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an
opportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.
Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be
effective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sending
a media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after
the hearing.

3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.

4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California
Capitol Week and the California Report) to secure
media interviews.

5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of
the amended language in SB 27x.

 What We Need From You

1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have
customers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please
respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact
information.

2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers
on behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to
do this for the you.

3.  If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with the
media it would be helpful to have this information so that we can
collaborate as necessary.

495,"Hey Buddy,
	Sorry it took me so long to write back, but it is tough to do at work and I kept putting it off.  Sorry about that, I will get better at writing back. So what is up man?  How has the sea been treating you? So what have you been doing, and what have you seen?  Around here the same ole stuff is goin on. Work, Golf and hanging out.  Thats about it.  Ferg got his new Yelliw Lab at the end of April. He named him Walter.  He's a pretty good lookin dog, but he has been cutting in to their sleep time.  Chris and Sarah had to start wearing ear plugs at night because the dog kept whining.  I thought that was pretty hilarious. Well, I finally got promoted.  I am now a full time trader. Its pretty cool, but ot can be real stressful. I'm still pretty much doing what I was before, but now I have to take full responsibility in all profits and losses.  So far its been goin Okay, but the days when you have on the wrong positions it can really suck.  Joanna's brother graduated last week from Galveston A&M.  He already got a job and started Wednesday for a shipping broker.  He is staying with us until July 1 then he is going to Paris to train for 3 months.  That should be pretty cool!  Jo is still traveling alot. She went to Toronto, Miami, London, and she is going to Berlin in June.  Wer might be going to Italy in September for our anniversary.  She is going for work and I might try to tag along. The weather has  been pretty good around here lately, all the Golf course are in great shape.  I shot a 77 the other day at FT. Bend - 41-36.  Pretty inconsistent, but I'll take it.  I bogied 18 to miss shotting 1 under.  How's Cass doing. I keep meaning to call her, but I haven't yet.  We miss seeing you guys and look forward to kicking back and drinking some beer and listening to all your stories.  I hope all is well and lookin forward to seeing you soon.  Keep our country safe, we're counting on you.  ""You and your faggoty white uniforms.""  Just kiddin - 

						Peace

Subject: Wedding proofs


Good morning, everyone.

Just wanted to let you know that we finally have some of our proofs 
available on-line.  It isn't our whole book, but it is a fair sample.  I 
think they got most of the pictures of you guys posted if you are interested 
in buying a print.  I believe you can order directly from the page.

If anyone wants to see more, call Andrea or myself and we can help you out.

Steps for accessing the proofs are:

1.  Point your browser to ""www.elanphotography.com""
2.  From the home page, select ""Weddings""
3.  From the Weddings page, select ""On-line Ordering"".  This will open a new 
browser window to a list of weddings shot by our photographer.
4.  Select the ""Childers/Luebbering"" wedding.
5.  This will prompt you to enter a username and password.
       Enter:
          username: childers
          password: gnirebbeul
6.  Browse at will.  I believe there are three or four pages of proofs.  If 
you drill down on a picture, you can order it there.

Let me know if you have any problems accessing this site.

Later,

Jason

ATTORNEY CLIENT  PRIVILEGED.



The assignment looks fine, but I don't understand the underlying 
transaction.  Is EEL transferring this domain name ""WEATHER-DESK.COM"" without 
any consideration other than using RMS' software program for six months?

Before executing this agreement, you need to secure Mark Palmer's permission 
since the agreement states that no variation of the name may be used.  He is 
the vice president of advertising at Enron Corp.  I have copied him on this.

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul

500,"Hi Vince, Stinson

Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet
with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very
productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more
clearly.

We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships 
(RA)
for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support
on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to
start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental
requirement.

Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can
do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having
pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early
September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September,
just before school starts.

I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous
e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please,
let me know how you would like to proceed.

Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive 
collaboration
during the coming year and beyond.

Best Regards,

Nick


PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area
in October.

501,"Utility's incentive program gets OK
Some East Idahoans will see rewards for reducing power use

The Associated Press 





Following the lead of their counterparts in Oregon, Idaho regulators on 
Friday approved a revised incentive program to convince customers of Utah 
Power & Light Co. to scale back electricity usage. 
The Public Utilities Commission approved a conservation program that rewards 
customers reducing their monthly demand by 10 percent from a year ago by 
reducing their bills by 10 percent. 
PacifiCorp, which serves about 56,000 eastern Idaho customers through Utah 
Power & Light, had originally proposed rewarding only customers who cut 
demand by 20 percent with a 20 percent reduction in bills. 
Significant curtailment in demand will reduce the amount of power the company 
has to buy at exorbitant prices on the wholesale market. 
But the commission, reinforced by environmental and consumer interests, 
questioned whether any customers would be able to reach that level of energy 
savings in a region where few have air conditioners. 
It asked the utility for more information to justify that plan, and 
PacifiCorp came back with the lower threshold for triggering the bill 
reductions. 
""Conservation gained through this program will benefit both the company and 
its residential customers by reducing the company's reliance on power 
purchases from the wholesale market,"" the commission said. 
But the three members also said they were ""still concerned that most 
customers will find it difficult to achieve the 10 percent reduction."" 
Last month, the Oregon Public Utility Commission raised the same questions 
about the 20 percent threshold for a bill reduction and eventually ordered 
PacifiCorp to provide a 10 percent threshold as well. 
The action followed a report that customers of PacifiCorp and Portland 
General Electric, Oregon's two largest utilities, trimmed electricity use by 
less than 4 percent during the first five months of this year despite 
campaigns urging conservation.

Even if you don't have time to read the story below definitely check out the
photo at the end.  That is one DAMN BIG feline!


Now this is a Big Cat!

Mr. Degagne recalls how 15 years ago he befriended two stray young cats on the old AECL research facility at Chalk River. The kittens had appeared in late summer and apparently had gotten under a security fence around the old labs, abandoned since the late 50's. With the help of his tuna  sandwich, Mr. Degagne was able to coax the kitties close enough so that he could  pick them up. A self described animal lover, he did not want to place the kittens in the local Humane Society. Later that evening his wife Louise and their two children came to a family decision to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found.  Lost was a female and Found was a male. When nature finally took its course, a litter of kittens was born 6 years later. One of the litter was a big white female with unique black markings on her side and tail.

Something about the kitten captured the hearts of the family, and while her siblings eventually found homes elsewhere, Snowball stayed with the Degagne's.  In her 9 years Snowball's size has seemed to snowball.  Put simply, Snowball is no ordinary cat -- she measures 69 inches from nose to tail and weighs in at 87 lbs.  She started out a big kitty and she just seemed to keep growing.  She always meowed for more food and would climb up on the counter to eat food which I forgot to cover.  Chicken is her favorite. 

""Once I left a cooked chicken on the table that I was going to use for a boat picnic, an hour later the chicken was gone,"" Louise said. We knew that snowball wasn't your average cat when the neighbor's German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter with her.  She just isn't afraid of any animals.  After we found a half eaten raccoon out by the garage, we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced in. We soon discovered that while we can keep Snowball in the yard, we couldn't keep raccoons from Snowball.  ""At least it kept the food bills down,"" Rodger laughed. ""Like all female cats she is very territorial, but with us she is just a big ole kitten,"" he said.
				
So what does a 87 pound cat eat? Snowball goes through about 3 lbs. of cat food a day, along with cooked chicken, supplemented with deer and moose that Rodger hunts in the fall.  She likes Pike a lot, so I don 't throw them back any more.  Snowball often accompanies Rodger fishing on the Ottawa, eagerly peering over the side of the boat as soon as his line goes tight.  So what do the Degagne's attribute Snowball's size to?  Rodger says ""Well,the vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn't fat, she's just a real big cat. I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River that they shouldn't have.""
				
NOW go have a look at ""Snowball.""

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Energy Producers Continue Expansion
Plans Despite Cautious Market in 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--The following is an
advisory by IndustrialInfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). It seems as though it was just yesterday that the California
energy crisis was reaching catastrophic proportions and Governor Davis
(CA) had all but deemed Houston the evil empire of the universe. All
eyes were on the states with deregulation looming on the horizon and
wondering if the next deregulated state would follow in the steps of
California. State governors and a newly elected Bush Administration
were scrambling for answers to prevent a regional crisis from becoming
a national nightmare. Prior to that Industrial Information Resources
had identified over 300,000 megawatts of new generation either under
construction or in various stages of planning and development. The
solution then was to build more power plants and add new capacity.
Also in response to the shortfall of energy production, the National
Energy Policy estimated the need for 1,300 new power plants to meet
future demand. Developers responded in kind, taking an aggressive
approach to meet our new electrical needs by developing and building
new power plants at alarming rates.
	   Wow! What a difference a year makes. Due to new capacity, milder
seasons and a shaky economy, lower demand and prices are causing some
to question the validity of the national energy crisis. No less than
seven states have delayed deregulation placing in question the future
developments of some new plants. Our economy, already in recession
took a nose-dive after the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, further
reducing demand primarily from industrial and commercial customers. To
close out the year we witnessed the demise of the Enron Corporation,
which could have far-reaching effects in the industry. As a result
many developers are heading into 2002 with a more cautious approach to
constructing new power plants.
	   On Wednesday one of the most aggressive developers in the
industry, Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN) (San Jose, Calif.) outlined
their revised future development program in a conference call hosted
by Pete Cartwright (chairman, CEO & president), Robert Kelly
(president of Calpine Finance), Charles Clark (senior VP & corporate
controller) and other members of Calpine's management team. Calpine
announced plans for completion of twenty-seven projects representing
15,200MW currently under construction. ""Upon completion of
construction of this program, Calpine will have a portfolio of
26,300MW of the most efficient power plants in the United States by
the end of 2003,"" stated Cartwright. Plans are to proceed with
thirty-four projects in advanced development accounting for 15,100MW
of capacity. Development of these projects will be completed to a
point where they are ready to begin construction and then will be
placed in ""hot standby"" according to Mr. Cartwright. ""We have ordered
all these projects be put on hold and no capital spending will take
place until we have had opportunities to do a thorough review of each
project."" Calpine had planned to spend about $2 Billion on advanced
projects in 2002. ""We intend to keep going with these projects when
conditions are right. We do not intend to have any significant
cancellations."" Plans are to continue with approximately 30,000MW in
early development originally scheduled to be completed by 2006. In
contrast, Cartwright says a number of his competitors are cancelling
and selling off their projects. In his address, Mr. Cartwright also
commented on the status of power markets, availability of capital and
earnings. ""Our goal, as it's always been, is to grow Calpine to become
the largest and most profitable power generator in North America.""
	   Calpine is certainly not the only power plant developer to
announce revised programs for the coming year. Companies such as NRG
Energy, Dynegy and El Paso Merchant Energy have also announced a
review of their strategies. Research conducted by Industrial
Information Resources has identified over 50,000MW of cancelled
projects since June of 2001, including projects by PPL and Mirant.
""While this is a major contrast from the beginning of 2001, all we
need is a speedy economic recovery, a harsh winter and a scorching
summer and it could be deja vu all over again,"" according to Britt
Burt manager of power market research for Industrial Information
Resources.

519,"Chris,

I got a call this morning from Bill Geist from Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  He is interested in ENA's agency, transport, storage and fuel management agreements.  I told him that we may be looking for a buyer of our Bridgeline inventory.  He was interested.  Call him at 402-758-6195.  He may also be interested in picking up the contracts also.

In the past the following folks have also expressed an interest in storage/inventory in the Gulf Coast.  The numbers are on our contact list.

Cook Inlet
Cinergy
CMS Energy Trading
Dominion
Marathon
Oneok
Sempra
Western Gas Resources
TXU

Be sure to ask them if there is any interest in picking up the storage contract and firm transport agreements.  I would tell them that both are discounted from the maximum tariff rates.

The IFIs have filed a suit in India seeking to compel various parties to meet their obligations under the PPA, but more importantly to prevent DPC from terminating the PPA and proceeding with arbitration.  The initial legal review is that this will strengthen our case on a number of fronts even though it may result in short term inconvenience.  However, we need to be cautious in the way we present this.  We intend to respond to media inquiries on this issue with the attached statement.  Please let me know if you need additional information.

ST-WBOM is long at PV parking with PNM for HE 2 through HE 5, 20 mws each hour--for Friday and Saturday. The price of the power after the parking fee is $15.50. The deal number is 826094. This deal is just hanging out there under W-BOM and should make us 80 mws long at PV on Friday and Saturday. 

Also--we are still short the two BOM pieces in SP-15 for a total of 50 mws each hour on peak-Friday and Saturday- average price of $27.60. You would have the deal numbers on this one.

Sweet.

Legal will not have their compliance policy completed by close of business today, therefore we cannot publish all of the information that we covered in the meeting ... therefore we aren't going to migrate anyone on Sunday night as I had previously stated. So we have a little reprieve ....

There is a possibility that we will migrate everyone Monday night ... I will communicate as soon as I hear a definite answer.

We will continue to work through the issues/points you raised today (thank you, by the way).

I do need your assistance on one thing ... if you know of people that are gong to UBS but will have to work to support Estate contracts next week (outside of the schedulers, I already have their names down) could you send me a list of their names?

"
535,"The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.  

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

 If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.

Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively ""a cost of capital"" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

Please confirm that ENA will not bear any insurance costs for the HPL assets for the second half of 2001 and the balance of years going forward?  If this is not the case, then we need to meet and discuss why this is not the case.

Thanks,

Paul
In addition to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.  

Jackie
Please remove these amounts from the ENA-HPL 2002 Plan.

Jim:
As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.

536,"To Whom It May Concern:


NEVP called at 21:00 and informed us the cut.  Dynegy was not able to resupply the energy so I bought APS tranny and power from EPE for $70.00 and will show it in the EL PASO model as a sell from EPE to DYNEGY 8MW @ $70 Palo Verde.  The Tranny from APS was $3.50, and I will show an annuity for this amount billed to Dynegy.  I built two annuities for the tranny purchase from APS and its subsequent billing to Dynegy (674830 & 674831).  The EPEC deals that relate to the cut are 674832 and 674833.

Please call me with any questions.

I talked to Jim about this today. He is going to contact the transformer people (Virginia) to see what they recommend. Jim is thinking they should stand behind this repair since it is a manufacturing problem. Since we are in tariff and no urgent problem exists at this time, maybe gas control will give us 8 hours in September to make the repairs.
Sorry it took so long to respond but this one got lost in my e-mail.
Thanks for your help Jim. We will talk again in week or so.

On the General Security Agreement, are we confident in Section 2 (a) that the reference to ""sale of goods"" that electricity is captured as a ""good""?

In Section 13 (a) (iii) time should not start to run from when an executive officer receives knowledge thereof. We should not be put in the position of uncertainty as to when time begins to run. This is an important issue and the monitoring and reporting within NP should accord it the appropriate importance.
	
In respect of your point 3. below, are acquisitions a real risk/opportunity for NP? In any event I feel we need to be careful about exercising corporate control over NP and should mirror their current corporate governance requirements, rather than impose new requirements. What do you think?

3. re acquisitions-no change to the way they can approve now re acquisition process, so 70% comes out. (robert-i did talk to bill and michael about and they are ok with as is b and b).
4. amend 7(c) of master agreement to say that they have to provide covenant compliance cert. which says whether or not they have a MAC--right now ways that they have to say they have no MAC. this amendment should survive the replacement collateral period and be for all time. that way they have to tell us only one way or the other and the MAC does not cause an independent default in 2(a) of the master. this is how we think should have worked to begin with consistent with our other masters.
5. keep negative pledge.
6. severance cap: say that no executive deferred compensation or ""parachutes"" or similar will be paid during the period with our released cash or any other cash unless we are fully margined with cash and they have released the a/r and inventory. they can pay ""pay as you go severance"" during the period (i.e. no lump sum/ and limited to what the person would have received in monthly salary ordinarily).  they can also pay any other severance stuff (i.e. $ under employment contract )capped at $500,000.

On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.  
 
Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen ""victor.""  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule.
 
Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction.
 
I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187.

Louise, 

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM. 
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental). 


I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Governor Chicken

10/22/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The two politicians who've arguably benefited most from the national focus on war are both Californians -- Congressman Gary Condit and Governor Gray Davis. Too bad Mr. Davis is finding he still can't avoid his own chickens coming home to roost. 
Only now are the folks in Sacramento learning that their Governor's ""solution"" to the energy crisis has been a political sham. A combination of collapsing budget revenues, foolish spending and bad credit ratings threatens to plunge the state into a full-fledged financial crisis.
Governor Davis's chickens left the roost back in May 2000, when California's botched scheme to deregulate electric power encountered a wicked price bubble. Wholesale prices, which had been deregulated, shot up, while retail prices, which were still regulated, didn't budge. This mismatch, along with other factors, generated huge supply disruptions and a first-class energy crisis. 
The obvious response would have been to let retail rates rise with the market price. Mr. Davis said so himself in his now infamous observation that if he raised rates, the problem would be solved in 20 minutes. Mr. Davis preferred to play the blame game, including a lot of whining that he had inherited the situation. 
While the Governor complained, California's two largest utilities were pushed into insolvency and neighboring states endured the double whammy of having their power sucked into California and seeing their electric rates shoot up. Californians suffered through rolling blackouts. 
Finally, this past January -- eight months after the energy crisis began -- the Governor responded: Retail rates were increased twice, and the state started to purchase power directly from suppliers, using money from its general fund. At the same time, the state negotiated contracts with suppliers at prices that are now well above market prices and for terms as long as 20 years. 
And then Mr. Davis got lucky. Although the forecast was for a summer of continued blackouts generated by a strong demand for power, the disaster failed to materialize. Not only was the weather cooler than normal, but higher rates produced immediate conservation; thus demand was moderate and power sufficient. Newsweek went out and hailed the Governor as a political Lazarus. 
But now here come the chickens. It seems that almost one-quarter of California's budget revenues were provided by taxpayers with stock options and capital gains, mostly from Silicon Valley companies. When the dot-com industry started to implode, so did revenue projections -- to $12 billion this year, down from $18 billion last year. And this was before September 11 and the collapse in the Nasdaq market. 
California would probably be able to absorb this revenue hit were it not for the still outstanding bills from the Governor's electric power fiasco. Consider the toll: 
-- Somebody is going to have to pay for the $14 billion that the utilities owe to suppliers for power consumed before the state started buying electricity. 
-- Somebody is going to have to repay the $12.5 billion bond issue that California hopes to float to replenish the money borrowed from its general fund. 
-- Somebody is going to have to pay for those expensive, long-term contracts that the state negotiated. 
-- Somebody is going to have to repay the bridge loan of $4.3 billion that California got from the banks hoping to underwrite the bond offering. (If this loan is not repaid by November 1, its interest rate jumps to 7% from 4%, resulting in an extra $250,000 in interest payments a day.) 
Whether these bills are ultimately assumed by ratepayers or taxpayers, or some combination of the two, the impact on California's economy and its budget will be dreadful. Observers are estimating a budget deficit of almost $10 billion for next year. 
As for Governor Davis, the problems of the ""previous administration"" are now his own. And Californians know it. A recent statewide poll showed that most voters preferred the former mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, the leading Republican challenger to Mr. Davis, by several points. 
The Governor's response to the ever-worsening economic situation has been typical. He complains. He vetoes a few spending bills. He announces a $5 million campaign to persuade Californians to help the local economy by staying in-state for their vacations. We expect to see a lot of chickens on surfboards.

Subject:	Palo Verde  Bottleneck - PLEASE READ
Importance:	High

Is this the only revision you'd like to see?

FYI -

Roger called today to inform us of a bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to ensure that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee to fill the lending short, then enter a zero priced buy-resale to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV. 

This is how it should take place - 
Day-Ahead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
Hour-Ahead	
	Buy from Counterparty such as PNM, SRP, TNP, or APS at FC or Greenlee 
	Buy-Resale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Summary notes from Tom Mertz
-There was an oil spill on the Block 49 platform off the coast of LA in Elod (sp?) Bay on an EOTT facility.  
- Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications.
- The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.  But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore.
- Going to do fly over.
- Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard. Coast Guard will meet us at site. 
- We have deployed US environmental to do containment and cleanup
-There is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore.

Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a bankruptcy filing that is attached below.  Besides the normal complaints, they are claiming that we have not nominated since the petition date (Is this true?) or paid for firm storage service (Is our storage gas out of Bear Creek and did ENA pay for the storage service that was used?).  The last four pages of the filing has a listing of the contracts that Tennessee has indicated are still active.  I will contact EES about their contracts.

As of 5:30 pm, the following was available on line from the Pacer system:


Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company today filed a motion:
(a) to modify the automatic stay to permit termination of contracts or, in the alternative
(b) to compel debtors to assume or reject agreements; and
(c) to compel payment of administrative expenses.

Tennessee contends that debtors have not utilized the capacity reserved under various agreements since 12/01 (with minor exceptions) and have not paid the amounts due under those agreements.  Tenneco is represented by F&J.

The amount allegedly owed to Tennessee that it requests payment as an administrative claim is $683,005.30.  I do not believe that Tennessee filed a declaration to support the facts necessary to establish the amount allegedly owed as an administrative claim.

I reviewed the motion with Barbara Gray.  She suggested I forward the motion to Kay Mann and Mark Ellenberg for their review and coordination with the Weil Gotshal counsel who dealt with the other transportation related motions.  Fortunately, unlike the Southern and Columbia motions, Tennessee does not claim setoff and does not allege that it holds any gas owned by Enron-related entities.

Hearing date: 3/13/02, 10 am
Response date: 3/8/02

A copy of the motion is attached.

Definition of The Day: Buying Power

-----------------------------------------------------------------
MARKET WRAP
===========

Chip Fest 2001

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC +1.32) gave its first-ever mid-quarter update
just after the bell, reaffirming second quarter guidance and
suggesting stronger earnings in the second half.  The company said
that second quarter sales would be at the lower end of the
expectations, but within expectations at least, as the world's
largest semiconductor maker struggles with a slowdown in PC sales.
Shares of semis were moving up in response during after-hours trading.

The company has been pummeled by weak demand for microprocessors
in the current economic downturn.  When it reported first-quarter
earnings, however, Intel had said it saw ""encouraging"" signs for a
stronger second half. This was despite first-quarter net income
plunging 82 percent on a 16 percent decline in sales.  Shares of
Intel have fallen 59 percent since its record high of 74.88 in
August, compared to the Nasdaq Composite index (COMPX) fall of 47
percent during that time period.  Intel gained 4.43 percent to
31.16 today during regular trading.

During the day, positive expectations about the Intel report
helped spark a rush to buy semiconductor shares.  In addition,
despite a weak earnings forecast from National Semiconductor
(NYSE:NSM +3.10) for the next quarter, the company commented in
its conference call that the improvement in the quarter has come
from quick-turnover orders from cell phone companies.  As a
result, the rally spread to stocks such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM
+2.42), Nokia (NYSE:NOK +1.24), and Motorola (NYSE:MOT +0.74).
Applied Micro (NASDAQ:AMCC +1.93) led the communication IC stocks
higher.  C.E. Unterberg Towbin analysts left a meeting with the
company with the notion that near-term order cancellations, push-
outs, and de-bookings had nearly evaporated.  That news also lit a
fire under PMC Sierra (NASDAQ:PMCS +4.65).

Also, last night the Semiconductor Industry Association projected
20.5 percent growth in 2002, which was revised upward from 10
percent, and 25 percent for 2003.  The revision may indicate that
a bottom is near in the sector.  Corroborating that view was Banc
of America Securities, which said that ""motherboard checks""
(sounds like fun) at Computex in Taiwan showed positive
indications for the third quarter.  They also noted that
conversations with four large Taiwanese manufacturers showed an
increase in OEM activity.  The Semiconductor Index (SOXX) has
jumped 19 percent since last Wednesday,s low of 578.40.  It,s now
at 697.04 ) a 7.7 percent gain today ) just beyond its pivotal
200-day moving average, which last month acted as strong
resistance that turned back the index nearly 20 percent.  Can it
move through it this time?

All of the action today was on moderate volume, which showed some
caution ahead of the Intel comments.  But when the dust settled,
the tech-bound Nasdaq Composite index (COMPX) picked up 46.27
points, or 2.09 percent, to reach 2,264.  The S&P 500 (SPX)
bigcaps were up 6.93, or 0.55 percent, to 1,276.96.  And the Dow
Jones Industrials (DJI), after being underwater this morning,
closed up 20.50 points, or 0.19 percent, to 11,090.74.

In other tech news, chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM +4.67) warned
of a steeper-than-expected sales decrease in its second quarter
and announced cost cutting plans.  The company slashed second-
quarter revenue expectations late yesterday, citing continued
weakness in the technology sector.  Nonetheless, Broadcom said in
its conference call that it saw signs of increasing new orders
that may well lead to renewed growth by year,s end.

Discouraging news from the retail sector came in today.
Unseasonable weather in the Midwest and Northeast lowered clothing
purchases in May, and high fuel prices and consumer concerns about
the economy reduced mall traffic, resulting in slow monthly retail
sales.  Large retailers including Gap (NYSE:GPS +0.61) and
Federated Department Stores (NYSE:FD )1.90) warned of additional
weakness in sales and/or earnings.  Also, Pacific Sunwear
(NASDAQ:PSUN )0.78) was downgraded.  All in all, it seems the
overall same-store retail sales pickup in April may not have been
the precursor to recovery that was thought.  Nonetheless,
electronic retailers were up today, partially due to good news out
of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY +2.38), which posted a 25 percent increase
in Q1 sales and said that quarterly earnings would be in line with
estimates. This news also sparked Circuit City (NYSE:CC +0.44), up
2.81 percent, and Radio Shack (NYSE:RSH +0.81), up 2.89 percent.

Shares of Philip Morris (NYSE:MO )1.48) and other tobacco stocks
started to plunge in after hours trading yesterday after an L.A.
jury ordered a record $3 billion payout to a smoker with incurable
lung and brain cancer.  Nonetheless, analysts -- and even
antismoking activists -- said the verdict likely would be reduced
by the judge or overturned on appeal.  Philip Morris closed off
its lows for the day to lose 2.96 percent at 48.52.  R.J. Reynolds
(NYSE:RJR )3.19) was down further, though, at 5.42 percent, to
55.69.

In other news, banking regulators said U.S. commercial banks
earned a record $19.9 billion during the first quarter.  This
number was ""padded"" by $1.2 billion worth of securities sales,
however, which masked more fundamental concerns about the sector.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. added that troubled commercial
and industrial loans continued to increase, especially at larger
banks, and interest rate margins continued to decline.  Banks
charged off $7 billion in bad loans in the first quarter, a 38
percent rise from the same period last year.

New state jobless claims rose to the highest level since November
1992, last week, revealing a still weakening job market, which may
not have bottomed yet.  New claims soared above the key 400,000-
level for the third straight week ) the longest string since
September of 1992.  Economists had expected a modest drop in
claims from the prior week.  Here comes the Fed?

Treasury prices gained early as a result of the aforementioned
jobless claims report that raised expectations of further interest
rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.  Then they weakened, as the 30-
year bond ) the most vulnerable to a potential inflation-igniting
recovery ) shed 31/32 at 95 5/32, with a yield of 5.72 percent,
for a gain of 7 basis points.  The 10-year Treasury lost 11/32 at
97 24/32, to yield 5.30 percent, a pickup of 5 basis points.  The
5-year note dropped 4/32 at 99 1/32 to yield 4.85 percent for a
gain of 3 basis points.  Finally, the Fed-sensitive 2-year note
was flat at 100 9/32, for a yield of 4.10 percent.

For Tomorrow:

There is a gap between what Intel is saying about the future and
what it,s box-maker customers are saying.  Who,s right?  We,ll be
watching to see how this plays out tomorrow.  See Intel run.  See
the market react.

Sector Watch:
=================================================================

As of Market Close ) Thursday 06/07/2001

One support alert was hit Thursday.  The Airline Index
(XAL) was unable to pull out of its nose dive in time to
prevent a support alert from being hit.  I doubt we'll see
any support alerts being hit in technology sectors in the
near future after Intel's postive guidance.  Lowering
support (XAL).

Play of The Day (Long)
===============

FOE - Ferro Corp. $22.54 +0.23  s/l $21.00

Ferro Corporation is a worldwide producer of performance materials
for manufacturers. The Company's portfolio of products includes
coatings for ceramics and metal, electronic materials, pigments,
fine chemicals and polymer additives, specialty plastic compounds
and colors. The Company's materials are used in a wide variety of
markets. These include building and renovation, major appliances,
household furnishings, transportation and industrial products.
Ferro's products are sold principally in the United States and
Europe, however, operations extend to the Latin America and Asia-
Pacific

Tonight, we add a small cap company in the chemical group to the
play list as a long. Since the beginning of the year, the Russell
2000 index of small capitalization companies has turned in a 5+%
positive return while the Nasdaq Composite is sitting with a 10%
loss. Looking at the S&P Chemical Index (CEX.X), buyers have
obviously been stepping up to the plate, with the index tacking on
an impressive 13+% gain since the beginning of Q2 alone. What
makes Ferro even more appealing is the fact that the group has
pulled back from gains of 20+%, retracing all the way back to the
20-dma; but bounced firmly off this support point last Friday, and
advancing 3.6 points or 0.8% today. Fundamentally speaking, Ferro
is experiencing weaker profits like the rest of the world, but did
manage to grow revenues 5% sequentially as reported in its last
earnings report on 4/24. The company posted revenue of $370.7
million and net income of $14.0 million or $0.37 cents per share
as compared with $0.48 in the first quarter of 2000. In a press
release, the firm's CEO, Hector R. Ortino, discussed several cost
cutting measures to assist in the earnings battle including a
program to reduce employment costs on a worldwide basis by more
than $12 million annually. When the markets are to fully recover,
deep cyclicals like FOE, as well as others in the group will need
to lead the way. While the stock was recently downgraded by
McDonald / Key Corp., we like what we see on the chart. Shares
have broken out of a trading range between $20 and $21.50, and
have done so on volume numbers that are far above average. With
the exception of some small speed bumps in the road, there really
is very little to stop FOE from making an attempt at a new 52-week
high ($24.70). Participation was a bit light today, however. MACD
sits firmly above the trigger line, as well as in positive
territory. As for an entry point, with $24.70 being a nice gain
from here, we see no reason not to get on board now. The more
conservative, really an oxymoron when talking about a chemical
stock, may want to wait for a pullback and bounce off of the
$20.00 to $20.15 level, if it happens.

Average Daily Volume = 125K
52-week: High = $24.70 Low = $17.62
Next Earnings 07-24 est = N/A versus = N/A

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we 
didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a 
point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their

573,"
Susan,
I mailed your tickets today.  They said that the fastest I could get them there is 7-10 days.  We should be able to make it, just keep checking your mail.  Your itenerary is as follows:
Tuesday, August 14
IAH to SFO    9:20am - 11:15am on Continental 531
SFO to Korea 1:00pm - 4:50pm on Korean Air 24, you will arrive on Wednesday, August 15
Sunday, August 26
Korea to LAX   3:00pm - 10:30am on Korean Air 
LAX to IAH       12:20pm - 5:49pm on Continental, you will arrive back in Houston on Sunday, 26th
Anyway, I think that's it.  I hope the itenerary is ok.  As far as packing I would bring clothes for hot, humid weather (about like Houston).  Nothing we do is very dressy.  I would say a nice shorts outfit or skirt is about as dressy as it gets here.  Wear comfortable, and shoes you really don't care about.  The monsoon season may be ending soon, but the streets are disgusting year around.  Bring your running shoes and I will try to keep you training for the marathon.  There is an ATM on post here that we can use free of charge, so don't worry about cash too much.  You can always write us a check.  We can also cash a check for up to $300/day.  Definitely do not change any money.  There are some places around here that give pretty good rates.  I would pack light and bring an extra suitcase.  You may want to buy some pottery here, or some fragile items so make sure you have extra room on your carry on.&n! bsp; Of course there's always mailing things, too.
There is a DMZ tour on the 18th, 21st, 23rd, and 25th.  Probably one of the Saturdays would be better for Chuck.  If we do go somewhere, we should plan on going the first weekend you are here.  That DMZ tour on the Saturday before you leave would be a long day, but you don't fly out until 3:00 the next day, so I think we could do it if you are game.  Can't wait to take you around here and you can see what we've been doing the past year here!  Have a good weekend!

Subject:	FERC Discussion on Standards of Conduct NOPR


My notes from the Standards of Conduct NOPR discussion:

Draft NOPR would:
adopt one set of standards to apply to gas and electric transmission owners;
broaden the definition to include all affiliates of transmission companies (including affiliates engaged in financial transactions)+
NOT apply to RTOs

The Commissioners were presented with 2 options:
Option A would maintain the status quo with respect to native load;
Option B would require separation of transmission function from bundled retail load.

It appears that there are 3 votes for Option B.   Breathitt was the hold out, expressing concern with respect to timing given that the FERC is trying to build a strong relationship with state commissions.    Pat said he was ""surprised"" to learn that bundled retail sales were excluded.  Massey sees this as an ""opportunity for discrimination to end.""   

NOTE:   Pat sent a message that, if he doesn't hear from ""people"" that this is the right way to go, he will back down.  He will be looking for factual evidence that on the costs and benefits associated with unbundling.   Massey asked staff if there are ""operational reasons why this change shouldn't be made.""  We may want to comment on this.

 ""de-orbiting"" the 66 satellites that make up the world's first low-orbit

 That means the first global satellite telephone network--variously reported

E-commerce firms hip to B2B before it was hot 
   Business-to-business e-commerce is all the rage these days, but a few 
consumer e-commerce companies such as eBay
   entered the market before it was hot.   The leading auction house opened a 
small-business exchange today
 where companies can buy everything from computer printers to nail guns. But 
the move is more of a change in marketing
 than a sudden shift in focus, analysts say.  Business trades have been 
quietly happening on eBay for some time, and its
 format inspired many of the exchanges that have cropped up, such as 
AutoExchange and Chemdex.

 Everybody wants to be a marketplace.
In sectors from cars to chemicals to food ingredients, companies are trying 
to join all of
 the participants into Internet-based markets for their industries in hopes 
of making businesses more efficient.
In some cases, they're taking the idea a step further, setting up virtual 
markets that
collect fees for all of the goods traded, creating what they hope are highly 
valued companies in the process.
Agricultural giant Cargill was the latest to join the trend, creating a 
market for the $300 billion food industry this week. The Big
Three automakers recently launched a combined e-commerce venture for auto 
parts ordering that they said would handle $500
billion in parts ranging from glass to semiconductors.

This thread is a little confusing but the upshot is that NP15-NW1 was undersubscribed (only 50 MW out of 165 MW bid upon) but the winning prices was very high: $10,000/MW-yr.

Hi Alan,
Sorry about that.  I didn't walk all the way through the numbers.  We had an
initial offer of 165MW but only 51MW were bid on so the remaining 104MW go
back to the TOs.  So 51MW times the clearing price of $10,002 gives you the
$510,102.  If you have any questions on this please let me know.

601,"
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Subject: CAISO Notice - Underscheduling Penalty and PG&E Bankruptcy
Claims Bar Date


IMPORTANT NOTICE
UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND
PG&E BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS
As you are aware, the claims bar date in the PG&E bankruptcy is September
5th.  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO
to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in
part by PG&E, the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the
underscheduling penalty is not modified by FERC.  FERC adopted the
underscheduling penalty in a December 15, 2000 Order.  Because there are
several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty,
to date the ISO has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing
pursuant to the underscheduling penalty.  It is our expectation that
Scheduling Coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they
schedule, information that is relevant to them.
As we have advised in prior Market Notices, although the ISO settles
transactions on behalf of Market Participants, the ISO is neither authorized
nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market
Participants in any bankruptcy proceeding, i.e. assert claims of ""ISO
Debtors"" against ""ISO Creditors"" (ISO Tariff Section 11.20.1).  Further,
while the ISO may be asked by an ""ISO Debtor"" to assert such claims in the
PX or PG&E bankruptcy cases, the ISO is not obliged to do so and will
decline any such request.  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any
Market Participant's claims, whether or not the Market Participant files any
such proofs of claim in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy proceedings.
Further, as we have advised in prior Market Notices, all statements,
including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty,
are subject to change.  A number of transactions are currently known to be
the subject of disputes and market reruns.  There are also proceedings
pending at FERC, Federal Courts, and State Courts, the outcomes of which may
affect amounts owed by PG&E to each Market Participant or by the Market
Participant to PG&E. In addition, we anticipate that further disputes and
proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect
the calculation of such amounts.  The ISO will continue to work diligently
to resolve these matters as quickly as possible.  Nonetheless, it is clear
that significant issues may remain unresolved and/or unidentified by the
claims bar date.
Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their
respective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX
and PG&E.

to Enron -- Coal and Enviro Related

Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of 
recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning 
that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental.

""The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the 
President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation.  The NEPD Group recommends that 
the President  direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose 
legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to 
significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and mercury from electric power generators.  Such a program (with appropriate 
measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health 
benefits even as we increase electricity supplies.

 Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury.

 Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the 
successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to
 the Clean Air Act.

 Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to 
their plants without fear of new litigation.

 Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help 
achieve the required reductions.""

""The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us 
meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our 
environment.  To that end, the NEPD Group  recommends that the President 
direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal 
technology by:

 Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal 
technologies.

 Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development 
tax credit.

 Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will 
encourage advancements in environmental technology.

""The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to 
provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation 
through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy 
and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, 
including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to 
the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment 
in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and 
environmental protection.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to 
review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure 
that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its 
regulations.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to 
support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to 
identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and 
incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with 
allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, 
market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue 
of global climate change.

I talked to Lisa this morning.  She said it does not matter to them if we use the travel agent or just do it ourselves.  She does not mind calling the travel agent if we want to do that.  She is real busy right now trying to get W-2's and 1099's out before the end of the month on top of other things.  She has been working late alot.  I guess we could check to see what we can find and then let them know.

The deals were actualized to zero  because the TXU pipeline statement shows no activity at the point the deals are scheduled.  Mike and I have spoken about the discrepancies.  From my understanding, Mike is in contact with TXU about these deals and others in question.  Currently, I am in a holding status awaiting the outcome. If you would like a copy of the statement I would be glad to bring it to you. 

Let me know if I can do anything more to alleviate the issues at hand.

620,"Good morning, everyone.

Just wanted to let you know that we finally have some of our proofs 
available on-line.  It isn't our whole book, but it is a fair sample.  I 
think they got most of the pictures of you guys posted if you are interested 
in buying a print.  I believe you can order directly from the page.

If anyone wants to see more, call Andrea or myself and we can help you out.

Steps for accessing the proofs are:

1.  Point your browser to ""www.elanphotography.com""
2.  From the home page, select ""Weddings""
3.  From the Weddings page, select ""On-line Ordering"".  This will open a new 
browser window to a list of weddings shot by our photographer.
4.  Select the ""Childers/Luebbering"" wedding.
5.  This will prompt you to enter a username and password.
       Enter:
          username: childers
          password: gnirebbeul
6.  Browse at will.  I believe there are three or four pages of proofs.  If 
you drill down on a picture, you can order it there.

Let me know if you have any problems accessing this site.

Later,

Jason

629,"Rick, Jim and Jeff:  Here's a draft of the e-mail I intend to send to Sandy 
and Mike re: use of Mike Day in Sacramento.  Let me know your thoughts.  




It appears from talking with both of you that we have some confusion on how 
we will contract for legal services to support or legislative efforts.  
Hopefully this e-mail will clarify the process so there is no confusion in 
the future and so that Mike can feel comfortable he is completing work that 
is authorized and for which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears that Goodin, MacBride has billings as of May 11 for 
approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall profits, the ""Global 
Settlement,"" Power Plant Siting.  We will cover these amounts because of the 
apparent confusion with our budgeting and approval process.  The amounts 
already incurred should be included in the RCRs discussed below.  

2.  As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May 
was conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know 
we terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs 
were filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis; the 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, a proposed budget is not RCR approval.  

3.  In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arises--i.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, then I should be 
contacted before completing any work.  If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes 
should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, then Rick Shapiro should be 
contacted.   In this regard, I authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in 
the Direct Access coalition meetings taking place today and tomorrow.  I also 
authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  To the maximum extent possible, I expect that Mike will 
include Leslie Lawner in future Direct Access meetings, legislative drafting 
efforts, etc.  

4.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, I should be contacted before undertaking an assignment.  
If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, 
then Rick Shapiro should be contacted.  I can be reached through my office 
line--503.464.7945, pager--888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  I wear 
the pager at all times and respond immediately to messages left on the 
pager.  

5.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride; it simply means that before that work begins 
Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and ""Plan B,"" to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  I 
recognize that Sacramento is a difficult environment and that there is 
substantial pressure on both of you.  However, we are under an obligation to 
use our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process is designed to meet that responsiblity.

631,"Greetings.  Here's the case with 1,3 and 4 compiled.  I took some editorial 
license with 1 and 4--hope I didn't butcher what you were conveying Jimmie 
and Dylan.  Check it out.  Still need to determine if folks are comfortable 
with my conclusion in #3, i.e., look, the biz model and the info provided in 
the 10K may be crap, but from a strictly technical perspective, Patten's 
justified in using the sales as opposed to the installment method.  Let me 
know.  Kim's up and running on #2.

Best,
Jeff

Re:  Enron Corp.

 We have received a letter agreement from Bank of America setting forth the 
terms of the referenced merger as they relate to our ISDA Master Agreements 
currently in place with Enron Corp. and each of  Bank of America and 
NationsBank.  Credit and Legal have agreed to the terms set forth therein.
 
1. On July 5, 1999, NationsBank, N.A. (""NationsBank"") changed its name to 
Bank of America, N.A.
2. On July 23, 1999, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association 
(""BofA"") merged with Bank of America,  N.A. and the surviving bank is named 
Bank of America, National Association.

Effective July 23, 1999, as a result of the merger, the following will 
occurr:  

1. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 8, 1995,  between Enron Corp. 
and  and NationsBank, N.A.  will remain in place.  Bank of America, National 
Association as successor by merger, shall be our counterparty.

2. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 4, 1994 and effective as of 
August 14, 1992,  between Enron Corp. and Bank of America National Savings 
and Trust Association  is terminated.  Any existing trades under this 
agreement shall be transferred to the ISDA  Agreement under number 1 above.

 A copy of the letter agreement will be distributed.

Subject: cost sharing of subscription to Poten's Fuel Oil Report  

All:
Ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many P&L's as need the 
report, minimizing everyone's cost by sharing a single subscription. 
Please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so, the RC 
code & co# for me to allocate your cost share.  Please indicate your choice 
of the three cost choices.

Attached note below clarifies Poten's proposal on the $10,000/yr subscription.
Essentially we have three choices:
1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly 
""special feature"" article)
2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly 
""special feature"" article, as in three attached examples)
3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for 
36 months.

Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No 
one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an 
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to 
others in the corporation.
The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles:
99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean
99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere
99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile
One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.  Some may 
be useless, others perhaps quite valuable.  Your call. 

regards
Guy

Dear Guy,

It was a pleasure speaking to you today.

As discussed, Poten is pleased to offer Enron the following two-part
fuel-oil related service:

(1) a one-year subscription to Poten's Fuel Oil in World Markets (Premium
Edition), and

(2) a forecast of delivered crude prices and fuel oil prices in Northwest
Europe (Brent and 1%S FOB fuel oil), the Mediterranean (Bonny Light and 1%S
FOB fuel oil), and Singapore (Dubai and HSFO-380 cSt).  The forecasts would
be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price
projections over the forward 36-month period. The forecast prices would be
accompanied by brief textual commentary.  The forecasts would be issued over
the course of the one-year Fuel Oil in World Markets subscription period.

The fee for the two-part service is US$10,000, payable in two equal
installments

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Larry

Subject: Poten's Fuel Oil Report

Niamh & Doug & Margaret:
I want to chat about this and will call you, but the essence is:

Can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to Poten's Monthly Fuel Oil 
Report? 
Attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month 
price forecasts.  The cost is $3800/yr.
As an added service for a total of $10,000/yr, Poten will include a quarterly 
update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and FO prices with a brief 
justification for their view.  This would include the standard monthly price 
forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24 
months for Far East, Med and NWE.  (I expect a more descriptive email from 
Poten, but I think this is the essence of their ""custom"" offer.)

The example copies attached include the following Special Features:
99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean
99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere
99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile
These type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects 
related to fuel oil.

I have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price 
forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself 
regarding the utility of such a report.  The best way to show your 
recommendation is with money.  If it is not worth any money to anyone else in 
ENE, then I have to question its validity and utility to me as well.  Doug, 
would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure 
to FO prices?

best regards
Guy

First of all....I hope you are feeling well...with all of the emails going

I just spoke with Lou Santorie with Sempra.  He said that they are very 
interested in Confirm Corp and would be looking for a company to partner 
with.  He said that basically ""if Enron would decide to use this application"" 
that the industry would have to get on board...basically sounds like he feels 
that we would set the stage for what is used in the industry as far a 
clearing applications.

We had a brainstorming meeting with the Commodity Logic team at 
lunch....their concepts are good for Phase I but we would get the biggest 
bang from their later Phase concept where they intend to do the automatching 
of deal info. between us and the Counterparty......

going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to 
look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.  Also, there were no 
counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached.

658,"I have thought about this problem in at least three different ways in the last 24 hours. In anticipation of a short discussion with you late tomorrow (once I am finished with Melon) or some time Friday, here's a suggestion for the continental bit:

	1. Constitute a  continental power and gas regulatory team within the overall group.
	2. Make membership of that team as fluid as possible to achieve interaction with the equivalent UK team (i.e. consider overlaps and/ or swaps.)
	3. Within the team carve out skills and specialities which will give a focus to a percentage of each individual's work (languages - preferably mother tongue - and geography being inevitably the most important determinants in most cases); attribute the remaining percentage of work to team priorities (gas v. power, anti-trust v. policy, pan-EU v. national etc. etc.) from time to time.
	4. Consider attribution of manpower along following lines initially:
		1st individual: 80% Germany, 20% team
		2nd: 40% NL, 20% Austria, 20% CH, 20% team
		3rd: 40% F, 10% B, 50% team	
		4th: 40% EU/ pan-CWE, 60% team (inc. internal and external co-ordination of the priorities?)
		5th: 40% Spain, 10% Italy, 50% team

You can probably guess from these attributions who I am suggesting could do what, but I think we should establish job requirements before considering individuals on their merits. If there is no fifth position, I suppose I would vote for servicing Spain with a member of the current UK team posessing the necessary language skills, and abandoning Italy (until instructed otherwise.) I have also ducked the difficulty of allocating administrative assistance.

Jim,  I contacted Doug Nichols of PGE on this, and the matter has to do with ""Edison Bailout"" bill (SBXX78).  Sue Mara is aware of this bill and a recent e-mail from her indicates that the bill was scheduled to be voted on yesterday and that it would suspend direct access as of 8/25.  I expect that Sue will report on the outcome of yesterday's vote.  In any event, Howard Weg, who represents PGE in the PX and PG&E bankruptcies, was asking if PGE was interested in supporting the legislation, but PGE declined to do so.  So... that's where the matter stands- it appears to be a moot issue.  Ray

This is the latest status on Howard's effort - PGE is included in the ""in favor"" group in Howard's message - but both Al and I have since let him know he should not include us as being ""in favor"" unless and until we've coordinated this with Enron - I'm relying on you to do that.  Time is very short - Howard needs to be moving on this now if he has any shot at all of influencing the outcome.  While I agree the message ought to be delivered, I'm not optimistic there is time for the legislature to do anything else at this point.

Doug and I have been debating wether there might be a broader Enron plan to support the legislation even with the 1 billion shortage to sellers.  We're still trying to get Enron guidance on this.  Possibly we'd rather have an expensive solution instead of no solution.  I'm traveling with my  cell phone all of tomorrow and Doug is working on Enron Central.

>>> ""Howard J. Weg"" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 08/28/01 09:35PM >>>
I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding
my email dated August 27, 2001 with respect to the proposal to contact the
Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE.

Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have
suggested that the message is too strong.  Our Ex Officio members BPA and
WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with
addressing the state government on this or other issues.  As you know, I
want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is
possible, and to protect the interests of all members.

Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against
SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for
bankruptcy or litigation.  After all, the Unofficial Committee was organized
to provide a different approach generally.  The purpose of contacting the
Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they
are now considering, which leaves SCE about $1 billion short on the proposed
financing to pay creditors, may cause some other sellers to take precipitous
action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or
arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower $2.9
billion level, which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally.
We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action
will be taken. The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is
not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether, only legislation
that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE.

The tone of the presentation, if we make one, will be low key, non
threatening, and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor
design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy, litigation and other
alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed,
leaving the energy sellers out in the cold.

If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be
associated with the message outlined above, then I propose that we give such
members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and
allowing us, if asked, to identify any such members that prefer not to be a
part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids
litigation and bankruptcy for SCE.  I understand that the LADWP and Coral
Power would like this approach adopted.

As I explained in my prior email, it has been suggested that the proposed
bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor
Day and before the Sept 14 adjournment.  That is why timing is important.
Those of you that have not responed, please respond.  Those of you that were
concerned that the message was unclear, please review this email and
consider or reconsider your positions, as the case may be.

As of right now, there are only 11 votes: 9 in favor and 2 against.  The
polls are still open so please let me know your position.

You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined
that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee
required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee.

Subject: Risk System Alternatives Next Steps

Lee,
Just to recap the meeting with Richard Burchfield and Steve Stock, based on 
the requirements that you and Vernon have identified, we would need to use 
several of the system components including TAG, ERMS, GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, 
CREDIT, and UNIFY for settlements.  All of these applications are tightly 
integrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would 
separate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and 
would be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity 
and integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it 
would be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as 
maintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the 
marketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate 
application images would not be good from an overall migration as well as 
support standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is 
also integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning 
on a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all 
are looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and 
would require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.

Regarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but 
we need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources 
from the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and 
database administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the 
process of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be 
possible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If 
we can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of 
these options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on 
sharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these 
applications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most 
timely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from 
Legal regarding this issue?  Thanks.

Hey Everybody,

Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine and copy both
sides of each license, credit card, etc. You will know what you had in
your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and
cancel in case it gets lost or worse yet, stolen. Keep the photocopy in
a safe place.

I pass this along, for your information, in case you hadn't thought of
it. We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed us in
your name, address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately (the author of this
piece who happens to be an attorney) had firsthand knowledge, because
my wallet was stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered
an expensive monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,
had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN
number from DMV to change my driving record information online, and
more.

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free
numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those

where you can find the easily. File a police report immediately in the
jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you
were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there
ever is one).

But here's what is perhaps most important:  (I never ever thought to do
this).  Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.  I had never
heard of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was
stolen and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By

the time I was advised to do this almost 2 weeks after the theft, all
the damage had been done. There are records of all the credit checks
initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about before
placing the alert. Since then, no additional damage has been done, and
the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It
seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

The numbers are:
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271

Do think about passing this information along. It could really help
someone.

Hi Misty!  When you e-mailed I was en route to Washington, D.C.  I just got

I was planning to come this weekend, but I seem to have come down with a

686,"SCE Reaches Agreement With Alternative Energy Generators

PR Newswire
06/19/01, 11:20p
(Copyright , 2001, PR Newswire)



ROSEMEAD, Calif., June 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Southern California Edison (SCE) 
announced today that it has reached an agreement with most of its renewable 
Qualifying Facilities (QF) power producers that addresses past payment issues 
and future pricing considerations, and creates a mechanism for ending 
numerous lawsuits.

""We believe this agreement will help bring stability to an important segment 
of California's energy market,"" said SCE Chairman, President & CEO Stephen E. 
Frank.

The plan was negotiated between the utility and key representatives of the QF 
industry and facilitated by Governor Gray Davis' office. To date, SCE has 
received signed agreements from QFs representing approximately 95% of its 
renewable energy capacity and today executed those contracts. The company 
hopes that the small number of remaining producers will also agree. Certain 
elements of the agreements are subject to the approval of the California 
Public Utilities Commission.

The plan calls for generators to provide power at a fixed price -- 5.37 
cents/kWh -- over the next five years, eliminating some of the price 
volatility that has plagued California's energy markets during the current 
crisis. The plan stays all existing legal action, and assures that no new 
legal action will be initiated unless the terms of the agreement are not met.

""The people of Edison are committed to pursuing the benefits of negotiated 
practical solutions to California's energy crisis,"" said Frank. ""The QF 
agreement and the MOU, if approved, are critical steps toward resolving the 
crisis. A bankruptcy, in contrast, would lead to years of delay and 
uncertainty for our customers and raise serious questions about the business 
climate in California."" 

An Edison International company, Southern California Edison is one of the 
nation's largest electric utilities, serving a population of more than 11 
million via 4.3 million customer accounts in a 50,000-square-mile service 
area within central, coastal and Southern California.

Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out for dinner pretty easy.

  Kelly - here are a few pictures - most look like they were taken on 
Saturday or Sunday - when a lot of the water had already gone down.  
Fortunately most of it ran onto the freeways.  The pictures that show the 
arched bridges on I -59 are a good example - the freeway at that spot is 
10-12 lanes wide and at least 30-40' lower than the bridge.

John,

Here are the simulations for:

Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
Roll to fill price gap

I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.


Normal Roll	No Roll		Fill Gap

   



Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged

My name is Brian Wood and I am an Associate who is currently up for rotation. I spoke with Shelly Friesenhahn from the Associate/Analyst Program and she recommended that I contact you about openings within your group.  I would be very interested in talking to you in order to find out if I would be a good fit for your needs.

I have spoken with an Associate in your group, Phil Polsky, and am excited about the business and learning opportunities in West Coast Gas Origination.  In my previous rotations, I have participated in a broad base of structuring, modeling, and origination activities.  To provide further detail about my experiences and achievements, I have attached my resume for your review.  

With everything going on in the company, I know it may be difficult to find time to meet with me.   Please let me know when it would be most convenient to stop by.  I look forward to having the chance to explain how I could provide value to your group.

Thank you for your consideration,

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

Interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by Tim - 
says a lot about the way MG do business I think.

RE NY we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( Philip 
Bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a DASH for each prepayment on a 
contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in NY and we may have 
some issues - although Marcelo and others stressed the fact that Concentrates 
appeared to move no product without a letter of credit, which was then often 
discounted to realise cash!!

Shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment 
yesterday from Philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were 
'unique' - whilst I can accept that each may be tailored to customer 
preferences - they still need to be CACSed - we should look at the 
enforceability/legal risk here.

Whilst information prepayment risk for Metals should come from London - 
accessing any relevent inofrmation from NY may be helpful

Will call later !

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

The situation at present is as follows:

MG have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper 
from the Russian Federation on a prepayment basis

all contracts are on a floating price basis (LME less discount)

notional value of each contract is circa $0.5-3mm

prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis, for between 90-95% value 
with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents

The issues break down into three broad areas:

1) Commercial

At present Enron does not engage in prepayment activities with Russian 
Federation counterparties.

No further prepayments are permitted until RAC have performed a DASH for this 
activity. As this is likely to take several weeks Howard will liase with 
Commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising 
from this suspension. Howard and David Hardy will also take immediate steps 
to manage down existing prepayment exposures.

2) Legal

Based on a cursory review of the confirmations by Robert, if we are to 
continue this activity Legal need to instructed to perform a full review for 
several reasons, including:

the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms, 
e.g. pricing date

they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments, and are generally not 
constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity.

""Conditions of Purchase"" are attached to the confirmations which refer to 
English Law, but as they are not always countersigned, under conflict rules 
the closest or real connection may be deemed to be Russian law which, in the 
absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability.

there are several ""open"" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are 
beyond the delivery period, and which could be considered to have been 
discharged by breach. Again the confirmation does not contain adequate 
language.

3) Credit/Operational

There are no formal counterparty limits. Nor are prepayment and volumetric 
exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis. This information is 
necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance, and needs to be 
factored into the overall credit monitoring process.

David has requested this information from MG, and will follow up this one off 
exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track 
exposures based on the methodology developed for Helsinki.


Further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that, 
despite the issues identified with contractual terms, there is performance 
against the contracts. David is pursuing this from a Credit perspective and 
will report back to his group his findings by Friday latest.

The issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to 
accelerate a planned review of contract language for all MG's activities in 
all jurisdictions. Mike and I will discuss bringing this review forward with 
Justin.

Any questions, please call.

Regards,
Tim

Subject: Invitation to Corporate Responsibility Task Force Meeting

As part of our commitment to responsible business practices around the world, 
we have recently launched a Corporate Responsibility function at Enron.  The 
further development, implementation and ultimate success of this effort will 
depend upon the participation and coordination of the business units and 
regions.

To that end, we are launching a Corporate Responsibility task force, which I 
will chair.  The roles of this task force will include developing and 
coordinating social and environmental policies, strategy, and information 
among the Enron business units; monitoring alignment of business activities 
with corporate responsibility goals; and providing a forum for business units 
to share issues and develop a consistent strategy.  Kelly Kimberly, Senior 
Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, and also of Marketing 
Communication and Public Relations for Enron Broadband Services, will lead 
the overall corporate responsibility initiative.  Additionally, because of 
their interest and experience working on these issues, Paula Rieker, Mark 
Schroeder and Rob Walls have already volunteered to represent their 
respective business units on the task force.

As a leader at Enron, I am seeking your participation, support and 
leadership.  I am asking the head of each business unit or major corporate 
function to either participate personally or designate a VP-or-higher level 
individual to serve as a member of the task force.  I look forward to your 
organization,s participation.

The first task force meeting will be in Houston from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  
Please choose one of the dates listed below, note your designee, and respond 
to Stacy Walker by Tuesday, September 19, by fax at 713-646-3248, or by phone 
at 713-853-3583.  Additional details, such as an agenda and a meeting 
location, will follow.

      introduction


Mike,

I'm putting together the keynote session for Interactive Energy and
wondered
if you'd be available on Tuesday morning between 8-11, October 24, at the
Houston Adam's Mark.  It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own
bed!

I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several
major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP
Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a
range
of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your
part.

We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman
from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably
have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll
have
a mud wrestling contest.

Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there
is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during
Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will
have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some
milestones
you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this
Texas business and government audience.

Look forward to your reply.

Thanks,

Bob

Mike,

Good to catch up with you and congratulations on a fine opener this
morning.
I think I heard you say that Enron currently has nine e-business ventures
underway and your development cycle from concept to implementation is just
90 days.

I would like to use these factoids in Jeff's introduction unless I heard
you
incorrectly.

Kind regards,

P.S. We're beginning to assemble the program for Interactive Energy 2000,
Oct. 23-26, in Houston.  I will e-mail you an invitation to participate on
the senior management panel Tuesday morning Oct 24th.

706,"We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

RE: POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE NOVEMBER 2000 METAL AND ENERGY 
CONTRACTS [NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)]
______________________________________________________________________________

As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals 
contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the 
first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month.  
Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the 
November 2000 metals contracts must be completed prior to October 18, 2000.

Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX 
energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the 
respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are attached.

If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Nick Galati 
at (212) 299-2920 or Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919.

NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(P) Concurrent Futures Positions

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent 
position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset 
memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing 
such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay 
in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its 
clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing 
member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the 
clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for 
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third 
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, 
including the termination date.  The current delivery month in platinum and 
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first 
business day of the delivery month.


COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the concurrent position 
is established the business day prior to the date that the open positions are 
filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for 
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth (10th) 
business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.
The current delivery month for Eurotop futures commences on the open of 
trading on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the termination of the 
respective futures contract, including the termination date.

711,"Jim:

Attached is a fairly distilled summary of the projects Enron's offered to the 
utilities, DWR and the ISO over the past 9-12 months, or so.  With respect to 
the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and 
Edison are included---the desk doesn't keep records of offers rejected, only 
offers accepted.  However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get 
more info on the other power deals offered to Edison, PG&E and SDG&E if folks 
would like that information.  Just let me know. Prices are included for the 
offers that had prices attached when submitted. 

Best,

"
712," The reason I feel compelled to put this in writing is that there is so much 
confusion regarding policy and procedures.  The distribution of practices 
around the firm is always surprising.  You are not being singled- there are 
just too many people who need to be informed to preclude a nice phone call 
from me.  This is not an exhaustive list, however, before we get on a sloppy 
road there are a few things that need to  be addressed immediately:

Only authorized traders may transact on behalf of Enron.  That means that the 
authorized trader memo is in my hands. 
Only Enron employees can be authorized traders.
All transactions will be done on recorded phone lines in Enron offices.
All transactions will be booked to the risk management system by the COB the 
day in which they are done.
All trades will be confirmed by us within 24 hours.
The person authorized by Greg and Rick to be in charge of the commodity group 
is responsible for the business front- to- back.  This includes p&l , 
position reporting, VAR, and systems.  As it relates to EnronCredit.com 
effort, this is Bryan Seyfreid.   

To clear up any confusion on this issue, Jeff, Rick and Greg have met 
extensively with Bryan and John and are fully supportive of the effort - as 
long as it continues to follow the rules and the ""spirit"" of the approval.  
The ""spirit"" , as I interpret it, is that the effort is to be complementary 
to the Financial Trading desk and RAC/Credit and not direct competition.  
That being said, in typical Enron fashion, there is enough grey for some 
overlap, so every one has to play nice.

While I do have as definitive an opinion on this as above, regarding the 
control of trading through certain funnels. it has been explicit practice to 
funnel certain types of transactions  through ""central desks"".   This is a 
good control mechanism even if it is a bit cumbersome.  MY preference is to 
put pressure on the ""central desk"" to provide execution services, structuring 
advice and operational help rather than building ones own.  As it relates to 
the Credit effort, it appears doubly important due to SFA considerations.  
Once again, I have a strong preference that we tread nowhere near the line 
and use the procedures established by Gary Hickerson's group to avoid any 
confusion and avoid an opportunity for erroneous human interpretation of 
complex issues.  Additional operational complexity does not appear to be 
sufficient justification for a more amorphous road map.

All comments are appreciated

714,"BIPAC endorses candidate for Special Election PA 9

Pennsylvania 9 Special Election - May 15, 2001 - Representative Bud Shuster
(R) - resigned

Candidates: Bill Shuster (R) - son of incumbent, auto dealer
Scott Conklin (D) - county commissioner from Centre County


It is time for PACs to gear up and take notice of the special election being
held in PA 9.

Bill Shuster's pro-business stance results directly from his numerous years
of insight into the business world.  For the past decade he has owned a
small business in his district.  Prior to owning his own automobile
dealership, he spent years immersed in the auto industry.  He worked for a
supplier in Michigan for a number of years, and he also served as regional
manager for Goodyear in the Washington metro area.

In his BIPAC candidate interview, Mr. Shuster proved that he was very
knowledgeable of the issues that are most important to the business
industry.  His stance on health care, trade issues, market issues,
environmental regulation, and tax reform all were cohesive to the objectives
business hopes to accomplish in the 107th Congress.

Despite the fact that this should be a landslide win with a Republican
running in a Republican district, you will more than likely see a very
competitive race.  There is a weakened Republican base due to competing
factions within the state Republican Party.

716,"Gang:

Further clarification on what happened at the pre-hearing conference today:

The Judge set he would rule on only two issues at this time (most likely the ruling will be out within a week):

1.  PX Audit -- The Commission will decide the issue on the current record (this is fine with us)
2. Implementation of Suspension of DA. -- This includes all the DASR issues, ability to make amendments as well as ESP assignments and the like.  The Judge decided he could rule after paper hearings.  The following schedule was agreed to:

11/16 -- Utilities file their proposal with the intent for it to be uniform for all three utilities
11/28 -- Parties file comments on utilities' proposal; may request hearings on specific issues and justify why needed (although the Judge already said he did not believe that hearings were necessary)
12/4 -- Parties file responses on the comments

All other issues will be addressed at another Pre-hearing conference on 12/12. 

In response to a question, the Judge said he would not issue a ruling on the retroactive suspension of direct access at this time, but did not believe that hearings were required on the issue.

He also said several times, however, that hearings would be required on all issues that involved dollars and cents. (To most logical people, this would seem to conflict with the notion that no hearings were required on the retroactivity issue  --  but, hey, this is California.)

Bottomline:  This turned out better than we had expected.  We wanted hearings on the money issues and any delay in addressing the retroactivity issue is good for our side.

Subject:	Update on California PUC Hearing--DA Suspension Implementation; Exit Fees; PX Credit, etc.--11.07.01

Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:

The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.
With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.  
The utilities said that hearings could be held ""sometime later"" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.
A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.
There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.
The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.
The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.
In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.
At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.
Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)
The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).
Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  
Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.
Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  
The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  
As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.
The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., ""why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info,"" etc.
>From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  
In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in ""serious negotitations.""

WASHINGTON -- Bill could erase price list requirement for competitive

WASHINGTON -- Lawmaker would give citizens tool against unwanted

FUTURE OF REGULATION
WASHINGTON
Bill could erase price list requirement for competitive carriers

The Utilities and Transportation Commission has forwarded a bill (HB
5380) to the Legislature that would give the commission the ability to
waive the requirement that competitive carriers file a price list with
the WUTC.  The commission staff explained to TR that under current law,
competitive carriers must file either a tariff or a price list.  This
bill would give the commission the discretion to determine whether a
price list should be filed.

The staff said that if the bill is passed, the commission would follow
up with a rulemaking proceeding, which would allow the industry to weigh
in on whether to modify or eliminate the price list requirement.

The staff said HB 5380 stems from issues relating to competitive
carriers and their pricing.  The staff explained that certain carriers
have quoted customers one price but charged them a different one.  When
questioned by the customers, the carriers said the prices being charged
were included in a price list on file with the WUTC.

HB 5380 also would ensure that competitive carriers and competitive
services are treated equally.  Under current law they are treated
separately, although both have minimal regulation.  For competitive
companies, the commission may waive any regulation, but that's not the
case for competitive carriers, the staff said.  This bill would strike
the statutory language governing both competitive carriers and services
and would write new language treating the two the same.

HB 5380, which was sponsored by Sen. Betti Sheldon (D., District 23),
awaits consideration by the House Economic Development and
Transportation Committee.

STATE & LOCAL GOVERNMENT
MICHIGAN
Parties discuss municipal rights-of-way fee structures

The Public Service Commission is hosting meetings with company and
municipal officials to discuss model regulations and fee structures for
franchise agreements with city governments.  The group held its first
meeting Jan. 18, during which it accomplished several organizational
tasks.  The second meeting tentatively is scheduled for sometime during
the second week of January, a Michigan Telecommunications Association
representative told TR.

In October 2000 the PSC fined the city of Birmingham $10,000 for its
practices regulating use of the municipal rights-of-way.  The PSC fined
the city of Rochester $20,000 for similar violations in December 2000.
(12/21/00 a.m.)

INTERNET
OREGON
Committee OKs digital signature bill

The House Advancing E-Government Committee has approved HB 2040 to
require the Department of Administrative Services to adopt rules for
digital signature use by state agencies.  The Joint Legislative
Committee on Information Management and Technology requested HB 2040 on
behalf of the Oregon Internet Commission.

HB 2040 awaits consideration on the House floor.

TAXATION
ARKANSAS
Bill would outline implementation of federal mobile telecom law

Sen. Jim Hill (D., District 5) has introduced SB 309 to allow the
director of the Department of Finance and Administration to decide how
to implement the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, which
was enacted last year.  The Act allows only local tax authorities in a
customer's ""place of primary use"" to tax mobile services provided by the
customer's home service provider.

SB 309 would help implement the Act by requiring the director of the
Department of Finance and Administration to determine how to assign the
place of primary use.  The director either could provide vendors with a
database linking taxing jurisdictions to addresses or ask vendors to use
an extended zip code at least nine digits long.

SB 309 also would amend an existing state law pertaining to the levy of
gross receipts tax on telecom services.  The bill would extend the list
of taxable long distance services by adding long distance messages that
originate and terminate outside Arkansas made by wireless phone services
that are billed to a place of primary use in the state.

SB 309 has been referred to the Senate Committee on Revenue and Tax.
Its text is available at
http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/ftproot/bills/2001/htm/SB309.pdf.

CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
WASHINGTON
Lawmaker would give citizens tool against unwanted telemarketers

Rep. Cheryl Pflug (R., District 5) has introduced a bill to create a
no-call list for citizens that don't want to receive telemarketing
telephone calls.  The state Utilities and Transportation Commission
would set up the list.  Registration would be free.

HB 1402 awaits consideration by the House Technology,
Telecommunications, and Energy Committee.

FUTURE OF REGULATION
MISSOURI
Bill would create e-commerce advisory committee

Sen. Sarah Steelman (R., District 16) has introduced SB 293 to establish
a committee that would advise state agencies on electronic commerce
issues.  The Advisory Committee for Electronic Commerce would operate
within the Department of Economic Development (DED).  The director of
the DED would chair the new committee and appoint 10 other members.
Each member would serve a two-year term.

SB 293 has been referred to the Senate Commerce and Environment
Committee.  Its full text is available at
http://www.senate.state.mo.us/01info/billtext/intro/SB293.htm.

Rep. Bill Luetkenhaus (D., District 12) has introduced a similar bill,
HB 447, in the House.  (1/22/01 2 p.m.)  Its text is available at
http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills01/biltxt01/intro01/HB0447I.htm.

INTERCOMPANY COMPENSATION -- EAS
VIRGINIA
Verizon South to implement second phase of expanded local calling

The State Corporation Commission has approved the second phase of a plan
to expand local calling in several Verizon South, Inc. (formerly GTE
South, Inc.) exchanges in the Norfolk area.  The exchanges include
Boykins, Chuckatuck, Courtland, Crittenden, Dendron, Franklin, Holland,
Ivor, Smithfield, Surry, Wakefield, and Windsor.

In August 2000 the SCC approved the first phase of the expanded calling
plan for exchanges in several local access and transport areas served by
Verizon South and Verizon Virginia, Inc. (formerly Bell Atlantic
Virginia, Inc.).  The companies' expanded calling plan implements a
condition included in the SCC's order approving the Bell Atlantic
Corp.-GTE Corp. merger, which created Verizon.  (11/30/99 a.m.)

The commission received nearly 50 comments from customers in the
affected exchanges, most of them supporting the plan.  Because
implementation will result in ""substantial rate increases"" for many
customers, the commission ordered Verizon South to issue a notice at
explaining ""applicable local exchange service options"" customers can use
to mitigate higher basic service rates.  (PUC000204, Joint application
of Verizon Virginia Inc., f/k/a Bell Atlantic-Virginia, Inc., and
Verizon South Inc., f/k/a GTE South Inc. to expand local calling between
various exchanges)

Letter from the Editor:

>From time to time, one of these newsletters elicits enough e-mail responses
that it appears a few folks actually read them.

That's really gratifying.

But humbling, too, since some of those responses tend to indicate that we
who work with this site every day may be assuming that our customers are
more familiar with where we put things than actually is the case.

We mentioned last week that we can create special Web sections for ongoing
stories and keep special sections from the newspaper around on the Web site
for a long time after the paper itself may have been misplaced.

Several folks asked where to find these items on the Web site; so we may
not have them as obviously available as we thought.

There is in the left-side navigation bar on all of the News sections of the
site (including the home page) a navigation segment that includes a variety
of special resources including breaking news from the Associated Press,
streaming audio news reports, strange and bizarre news stories -- and a
section labeled ""News Specials.""

It's that ""News Specials"" section where we keep all of the various special
sections we make available on the Web site. You can short cut directly to
it at http://www.HoustonChronicle.com/specialreports or you can just use
the navigation link to open it up.

The major ongoing special sections right now involve Enron developments,
the Andrea Pia Yates trial and the country's continuing responses to the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. The page also includes stories still coming
from the June flooding brought on by Tropical Storm Allison.

Special sections from the various areas of the newspaper -- news, features,
sports -- are maintained online in this area as long as they remain of
interest. While some stories from this part of the site -- perhaps the war
in Kosovo -- begin to fade after a time and drop off the Special Reports
page, others -- like the dragging death of James Byrd Jr. -- likely will
remain for years to come.

We even include some special ""Webumentary"" pieces that we have created for
the Web site in cooperation with the staff of the newspaper. These are
articles where we get to work with the writers and photographers as the
story is being developed so that we can add interactive multimedia coverage
to extend the story beyond the limits available in print. A couple of
examples from the current Special Reports area would be pieces called
""Where Ghosts Dwell"" and ""So you wanna be a rock & roll star?"" 

As new stories come along, they will be added. Next up likely will be the
2002 Winter Olympics from Salt Lake City, taking a spot on the page
alongside the coverage already there of the 2000 Summer Games in Australia.

Not all ongoing stories will end up in this section. Some will show up on
the Web site only while they are going on and then will fade away, but the
Special Reports page is a good place to check for stories that you think
might qualify for special extended coverage.

Thanks for visiting, and please let us be your first source for
information.

**Political Recommendations

It does seem that the election process never ends any more. 

Only a few weeks ago, we were going to the polls to cast votes in the
run-off contests to finish settling the 2001 campaigns.

But here we are again in the thick of political posturing as candidates
line up for the 2002 primary contests to decide candidates for this year's
November elections for officials all the way to the U.S. Senate. 

As always, the Chronicle's Editorial Board meets with all of the candidates
trying to get a handle on which are the best of the lot and then shares
this experience with you in the form of recommendations in the various
races. 

This is not a Voters Guide, which we also will provide closer to the
election and which will provide more complete information on all of the
candidates. More like the arts and movie critics of the paper offering
their opinions in the form of reviews, the newspaper's political
recommendations need to be coupled with your own views as you form your own
opinions.  

But whether you consider these recommendations as wise suggestions or an
indication of who you definitely don't want to vote for, we offer them for
your consideration from time to time on the Editorial page of the paper.
And assembled into a complete collection available from either the
Editorial or Politics pages on the Web site.

Check the candidates out at:
http://www.HoustonChronicle.com/recommendations

:::::

*What's New at HoustonChronicle.com

**ThisWeek

In addition to covering major news events throughout the metropolitan
Houston area every day, the Chronicle produces 17 different neighborhood
community sections that are included in the paper each week.

Well, actually, each of the ThisWeek publications normally fills a couple
of broadsheet sections to be included in the paper each Thursday.

The community publications are produced by a division of the news
department and include lots of neighborhood news that might not be of
widespread interest to other neighborhoods but can be of great interest to
the local community. 

We here on the Web site don't want you to miss this more personal version
of the news either; so we post articles from all 17 ThisWeek publications
on the site each Thursday, and maintain the pages throughout the week until
the next pulication date rolls around. 

On the home page, you'll find a link for ""ThisWeek"" in that same left-side
navigation segment with the News Specials and the AP breaking news links.  

It's a little redundant, but we thought it might be helpful; so we included
links to the ""ThisWeek"" section of the site in the navigation bar for folks
opening the links to Community resources and the Metro & State news section
as well.

**Archives Access for Non-Subscribers

For a couple of year now, the online archives of the Houston Chronicle and
the Houston Post have been open to Houston Chronicle subscribers. Those of
the Post are offline for some review right now. And HoustonChronicle.com
has partnered with Qpass to provide an easy and safe way for
non-subscribers to purchase access to archival material online.

Three kinds of passes allow non-subscribers to search the archives. One is
for 30 days, another for seven days, and a third lasts for 24 hours.  To
buy a pass and start a search, simply go to

http://www.HoustonChronicle.com/archives

That site also includes answers to any questions you might have about
this new service.

Please note that the Houston Chronicle archives includes only text of
news articles appearing in the Chronicle starting in 1985. It does not
include photographs, classified ads or paid death notices. As part of the
SubscribersADVANTAGE program, the archives remain free to Houston Chronicle
subscribers.

Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the 
following information by the end of the day today:

How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day 
or as of midnight?
How much of the gas went into California?
What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.  
I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information 
confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.

Subject: Questions regarding PSD permit for Lincoln


Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring ("" CEM"") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

Subject:  ""No Excuse"" Girls Night  (Document link: Michelle Blaine)

Hello everyone!!

Well, no one is celebrating anything specific, so we haven't had an
opportunity
for the girls to get together in a while.  Therefore, we have decided to
have a
NO Excuses Girls Night.

The proposed date is Friday, Sept. 29 -- Are there any major conflicts with
this
date?

Proposed place is to be determined.  Debbie Rank suggested that a restaurant
would be the easiest.  I offered to have it at my house, but she was
concerned
that I would get stuck doing too much and spending too much.  My thought is
that
if everyone agrees to chip in a bit, we can have it catered, and no one will
have to do too much or pay too much.  What do you think about that?

If you are interested, let me know.

Also, this first email is limited to those persons for whom I had email
addresses.  Many others should be added to this list, including:  Mary
Thamm,
Lisa Anouilh, Deanne Noel, Tamberly Thomas, and others whom I am sure to
have
forgotten.  Please forward this on and have everyone get back to me if they

John Neslage is working on ensuring the accuracy of the numbers and providing

By the way, the ""soft"" and ""intangibles"" are getting difficult to keep

Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's 
assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:

LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh

LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 
gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)

No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 
131,850 Btu/gallon)


Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 
100%. Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.

Call me if you have any additional questions.

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as ""President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division"".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

Votenet Announces Online Voter Registration Software in Spanish

Washington, D.C. - In support of today's White House celebration of the National Hispanic Heritage Month, Votenet Solutions, Inc. is pleased to announce the Spanish language version of its pioneering Votenet Voter Registration software. The Spanish speaking population in the United States increased by an unprecedented 13 million or 62 % from 22 million in 1990 to 35 million in 2000! The political ramifications of this demographic change are expected to be far reaching. The first step in becoming an involved and informed citizen is registering to vote.  Votenet's Registro De Votacion will provide Hispanic Americans a streamlined and simplified approach to the voter registration process. 
Associations and advocacy groups can add the online voter registration software to their web sites for as little as $995.00 per year.  The features in Spanish include: 
Register to vote  
Report a name change to the voter registration office 
Report a change of address to the voter registration office 
Register with a political party 

Votenet's Voter Registration software will have a dramatic impact in areas with large Hispanic populations including: Florida, Texas, New York, and California.  All of these areas were critical in the 2000 election cycle.  ""With only 50% of Americans voting at the national level, this software enhancement has the ability to raise that number significantly,"" stated Mitch Reisberg, Vice President of Votenet's Sales. 
""We are very excited about adding the Voter Registration in Spanish capability to the Votenet suite of public policy solutions. We believe this product enhancement will add a unique dynamic to voter activism.  All American citizens should exercise their right to vote and Votenet Voter Registration facilitates the first step; registering to vote.  This Spanish language version recognizes the reality that the Hispanic population is the fastest growing segment in the United States,"" said Glen Hughlette, President and CEO of Votenet Solutions. 
The online Voter Registration product, in English and/or Spanish, is available from Votenet Solutions.  Interested groups can learn how to license the software by visiting either http://www.votenet.com  or calling 1-800-VOTENET.

Bizarre facts of this world

In Lebanon, men are legally allowed to have sex with
animals, but the animals must be female. Having sexual
relations with a male animal are punishable by death.
(Like THAT makes sense.)

In Bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a
woman's genitals, but is prohibited from looking
directly at them during the examination. He may only
see their reflection in a mirror.

Muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a
corpse. This also applies to undertakers; the sex
organs of the deceased must be covered with a brick or
piece of wood at all times. (A brick??)

The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is
decapitation.

There are men in Guam whose full-time job is to travel
the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay
them for the privilege of having sex for the first
time... Reason: under Guam law, it is expressly
forbidden for virgins to marry. (Let's just think for
a minute; is there any job anywhere else in the world
that even comes close to this?)

In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to
kill her adulterous husband, but may only do so with
her bare hands. The husband's lover, on the other
hand, may be killed in any manner desired. (Ah!
Justice!)

Topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England -
but only in tropical fish stores.(But of course!)

In Cali, Colombia, a woman may only have sex with her
husband, and the first time this happens, her mother
must be in the room to witness the act. (Makes one
shudder at the thought.)

In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, it is illegal for a man to
have sex with a woman and her daughter at the same
time. (I presume this was a big enough problem that
they had to pass this law?)

In Maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from
vending machines with one exception: prophylactics may
be dispensed from a vending machine only ""in places
where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on
the premises."" (Is this a great country or what? Not
as great as Guam!)

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you
would have produced enough sound energy to heat one
cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it)

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months,
enough gas is produced to create the energy of an
atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it)

A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life
I want to be a pig)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an
hour. (Still not over that pig thing)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex
for pleasure. (Is that why Flipper was always
smiling?)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hummm....I won't touch THAT one!)

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30
times its own weight and always falls over on its
right side when intoxicated. (From drinking little
bottles of...?) (Did the govt. pay for this
research??)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (In my next life
I STILL want to be a pig ... quality over quantity)

Butterflies taste with their feet. (Ah, geez)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain. (I know
some people like that.)

Starfish don't have brains. (I know some people like
that too)

After reading all these, all I can say is.......Damn
Those Pigs.

Today's focus: New Red Hat patches available

By Jason Meserve


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* Red Hat patches pine

A problem with the way pine, a popular e-mail reader for
Unix/Linux, handles URLs embedded in a message could allow a
malicious user to execute arbitrary commands on the affected
system. Red Hat users can get more information and download the
appropriate patch from:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-009.html


* Patch available for uuxqt utility

Red Hat has patched the uuxqt utility that ships with the
Taylor UUCP package. A flaw in the code does not remove long
options, which could be exploited to allow local users to gain
uid and gid uucp privileges.  For more, go to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-165.html


* Updated enscript package available

According to an alert from Red Hat, GNU enscript, a program for
converting ASCII files to PostScript, contains a vulnerability.
When it creates temporary files, it does so with predictable
filenames in a manner that would follow symbolic links. This
could allow a local user to overwrite files written by the user
running enscript or read the contents of the temporary files.
For more, go to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-012.html


* FreeBSD fixes k5su

A fix is available for k5su, a Kerberos 5 version of su.
Previous releases could allow a nonprivileged user to gain
superuser privileges. FreeBSD users can get more information
and download the appropriate fix from:
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:07.k5su.asc



* Linux-Mandrake patches stunnel

The stunnel package for Linux-Mandrake contains a string format
vulnerability. A malicious user could exploit this flaw to
execute code as the owner of the stunnel process. For more, go
to:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/security/2002/MDKSA-2002-004.php


* Patch available for at package

A bug in the at package could lead to a heap corruption. A
malicious user could exploit this to gain the daemon's user
privileges. For more, go to:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/security/2002/MDKSA-2002-007.php


* Conectiva patches MySQL

MySQL is a popular database shipped with many versions of
Linux. Conectiva has released a patch for the database to fix a
problem with the way MySQL sets world-readable permissions for
certain log files. The files record most commands sent to the
database, including change password commands. For more, go to:
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000455


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* W32/Klez-E - A Windows virus that spreads via Outlook or
network-attached drives. The virus will attempt to delete
certain file types and disable any installed anti-virus
software. (Sophos, Computer Associates)

* W32/ElKern-B - This is a virus dropped by the W32/Klez-E
worm. It's an executable that runs on Windows 98, ME, 2000 and
XP. No word on the damage it may cause. (Sophos)

* W32/Klez-F - Much like W32/Klez-E, this virus spreads via
Outlook and network-attached drives. It disables anti-virus
software and drops another virus on the infected machine.
(Sophos, Panda Software)

* WM97/Marker-KC - A Word macro virus that FTPs summary
information to the codebreaker's Web site when the infected
document is closed. (Sophos)

* XM97/Laroux-OM - An Excel macro virus with no malicious
payload. It creates a file called Negs.xls in the XLSTART
directory. (Sophos)

* VBS/NetLog.B - A virus written in VBS that scans a range of
IP addresses looking for shared C: drives to infect. A
distributed denial of service attack could occur if a number of
infected machines reside on the same network and are actively
scanning for new hosts. (Panda Software)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Top Web services worry: Security

The absence of security and reliability is proving to be a
major stumbling block in convincing companies that Web services
can thrive outside of corporate firewalls.

Network World, 01/21/02


* Vendors tout easier VPNs

A new breed of products is emerging to rival traditional
Internet-based VPN offerings that give remote users and
business partners secure access to corporate networks. The IP
Security VPN alternatives promise to save customers vast
amounts of administrative time by using easily configurable
hardware and requiring little or no software on remote
machines.

* Another IPSec VPN alternative

While some vendors are threatening IP Security VPN dominance on
the remote access front, newcomer Flatrock is trying to horn in
on the site-to-site connectivity side of the business.

785,"FYI only -  

Please see some preliminary information on proposals in New York State to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

I am awaiting more information from Suffolk County and more information on which entities this would impact as well as the scale of the reductions.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

-------------------------------------------------

Analysis of New York Legislation and Action on Carbon Regulation

Background

Government interest in addressing local air pollution and global warming has led to several initiatives in New York to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (CO2).  CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global climate change.  In the absence of a national U.S. approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, several states and municipalities, mostly in the Northeast, have passed legislation or initiated programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Currently, the U.S. Congress and the Bush Administration are considering domestic plans to address climate change.  However, in contrast to statements made during the presidential campaign, President Bush has said that he would not support mandatory regulation of CO2 at power plants under federal programs to regulate multiple pollutants (NOx, SO2 and mercury) or to combat climate change.  Several moderate and Northeastern Republicans as well as many Democrats support inclusion of CO2 in multipollutant plans.  The U.S. Senate will likely consider climate change legislation and could consider multipollutant legislation before the end of the year.  Hearings are underway, and several bills have been introduced, but the timing on Senate floor consideration is uncertain.  The U.S. House of Representatives is not moving as fast on either issue, making the adoption of a national climate change plan or new federal regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions at least a year or, more likely, several years away. 

Suffolk County Legislation to Reduce CO2 Emissions from Power Plants

In late July, Suffolk County Executive Robert Gaffney signed legislation to regulate CO2 emissions from electric generating units and steam generating units in Suffolk County with a capacity of more than 25 megawatts.  This is the first of such measures adopted in NY state and will go into effect in March 2002.  Quarterly reporting is required, and Suffolk's Division of the Environment will issue rules by October 1, 2001.

The initial allowable emission rate would be 1,800 pounds of CO2 per MWh. In each subsequent year, the rate would be reduced by 1% for each 100 MW of new generating capacity added in the county, until a 20% reduction has been achieved. Power plant owners could comply by upgrading equipment, switching from oil to gas, purchasing CO2 credits, or investing in energy efficiency or renewables. If they failed to comply, plant owners would be fined $ 2 per ton of CO2 above the limits in the first year, and $ 3/ton in following years. 

Most of the plants on Long Island were built by Long Island Lighting and acquired in 1998 by KeySpan Energy when LILCO merged the generation and gas portions of its business with Brooklyn Union Gas to form KeySpan.  KeySpan has about 2,880 MW in Suffolk County, including two big steam stations and some combustion turbines.  Some say that KeySpan could meet the target by re-powering its steam plants to combined cycle.  However, according to KeySpan that could require coming off line for up to a year, which in Suffolk's tight energy market would be disrupting.  According to the County, there are several new natural gas merchant plants under development that would also be required to meet the standard.  Industry met with the County officials and substantial revisions to the legislation were made.  

Emissions trading is permitted, and press reports indicate that credits can be generated inside or outside of Suffolk County.  I am looking to confirm this, as initial drafts of the bill stated that credits must be generated in Suffolk County.  Rules for quantifying emissions credits have not yet been set.

Issues for Enron:  

Will this have an impact on long term power contracts in Suffolk County?
Does EES have customers in Suffolk County that could generate credits under the program?
If credits can be generated by uncapped sources or sources outside of Suffolk County, does Enron have credits to sell?

New York State Assembly Multipollutant Bill

In late June, the New York Assembly passed a bill that would regulate emissions of NOx, SO2, and CO2 from electric generators of 15 MW capacity or larger. The bill requires the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to adopt regulations implementing reductions in emissions of CO2 by January 1, 2002 and requires the DEC to establish a cap on total emissions of CO2, equivalent to 1990 emission levels, by January 1, 2007. 

The State Senate is also considering multipollutant legislation, but is not expected to pass companion legislation.  Consensus does not exist in the Senate on regulation of CO2.

Further, observers feel that the crafters are not fully aware of the implications of these bills, increasing the likelihood that they will not move further anytime soon.

Governor's Climate Change Task Force

In early June, NY Governor George Pataki today announced the formation of a Greenhouse Gas Task Force to develop policy recommendations for greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. The Task Force is comprised of representatives from the business community, environmental organizations, state agencies, and universities. 

Pataki has been outspoken on calling on the federal government to take action on multipollutant plans, and has encouraged the inclusion of CO2.   

The Task Force will report back to Governor Pataki with specific policy recommendations on or before November 15, 2001.  The recommendation will be considered for inclusion in a draft state energy plan to be completed in December 2001. A final report from the Task Force is due by March 2002, and the final energy plan will be released in the Spring of 2002.

The Task Force is just getting underway, and its members have divergent views on whether to regulate CO2.  Two subgroups exist, one that deals with registries and trading (brokers, marketers, some NGOS and industry) and the other deals with power plants (mostly power generators).  

At this time, the power plant group tends to oppose mandatory CO2 regulation, while the registry and trading subgroup is more supportive of it.
 
NYC Council Proposal to Reduce CO2 Emissions

The NY City Council is considering legislation to regulate CO2 as well.  Similar in some fashion to the Suffolk County bill, it would require power generators greater than 25 MW to reduce CO2, eventually leading to a 20% reduction from 1999 levels.  

The regulation would apply to units operating in 1997-1999.  Newer units will not be part of the overall reduction, but must meet emission rates. A trading program would be possible and there is a fine of $3 for every ton above the allowed emission rates. 

Trading is permitted, and credits could be generated from energy efficiency, renewables, fuel switching, etc. from other entities in the City.  

There is fairly wide support for this legislation and despite an election this fall that will result is significant turn-over in Council members, observers feel that the legislation will pass in the next year (if not this fall).

Subject: UT & atm flag football

I've received the fund raising envelopes for the flag football tournament.   
I need everyone to pick these envelopes and begin collecting for UT.

I'm at 2918b or you can send me your location and I will  try to use the 
interoffice mail.

Alternatively, you can just solicit on your own without the envelope (which 
makes it more official).   Keep in mind that contributions will be matched by 
Enron and make checks payable to the University of Texas at Austin.  Last 
year we donated about $30 K to A&M Bonfire memorial scholarship efforts.  
Money collected this year will goto the general scholarship fund at UT.


Each team is expected to raise $2000  and we have less than 20 days left, so 
do your part.

---

Also, if anyone is interested in practicing this weekend or next, let me know 
and I will try to arrange it.  Webb's team is not practicing.

Finally, we're still short 2 guy players.

792,"Looks good, Scott.  One thing:  I admit I'm not a lawyer, so someone needs to 
show me the precise language in AB 1890 that 1) requires the credit (which, I 
believe was created by the PUC, not the legislature) to be based on market 
and 2) requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers. 

Mike Day:  Do you concur with Scott's interpretation in AB 1890?

Like your arguments, Scott.  Just want to clarify that we're on solid legal 
ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief and/or protest. 

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Re: SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit -- Protest

We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that 
the Px credit should be based on DJ-NP15 and DJ-SP15 rather than the defunct 
Px because AB1890 requires it to be based on market (not costs).  Changing to 
procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB1890 which requires DA 
customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers.  
And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJ-NP15/SP15, that is the only 
appropriate available method.  

Further, the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA 
customers should be charged the generation surcharges ($10 +$30).  DA 
customers should be given market based Px credits (based on DJNP15/SP15) 
because its the law.  There are 2 possible interpretations resulting from the 
combination of AB1890 and the new law.  
The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any 
surcharge.
The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the $30 + $10 
surcharges
Interpretation 1 results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other 
customers.  It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent.
Interpretation 2 results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other 
customers until the end of AB1890.  This seems like the likely interpretation 
since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB1890.  Thus given 
that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus $40, 
they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the 
rate freeze ends.

Once the Px credit ends (Mar 2002), the surcharge should end because the law 
(AB1890) no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because:
Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the 
utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should 
not be charged for them.

In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value (if the courts 
interpret the law differently than Enron) then there should be no generation 
surcharge for DA customers.

This is the same argument we should make in our brief on rate setting
Scott

Subject: SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit -- Protest


As you are aware, SCE made an advice filing on April 5th to eradicate the PX
Rate Schedule and Replace it with Schedule PE --Procured Energy.  As part of
the filing, SCE proposes to set ""on an interim basis"" the cost of energy
procurement, for bundled service customers for billing purposes and in the
calculation of the energy credit for direct access customers equal to the
Generation rate component of the Customer's otherwise applicable tariff.

Two primary issues arise from SCE's statement. First what does ""interim
basis"" mean -- how long will this be in effect.  In starts on January 19th,
but it is unclear as to when it would end. Second, and most important. is
what is meant by the Generation rate component.  While there is not much
explanation in the April 5 advice letter, in a subsequent advice letter
filed on April 11 (1533-E), SCE set forth ""Rate Schedule Specific Generation
Related Rates"" which range between five and nine cents.

I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier.  We need
to protest the change in the PX credit by Wednesday, April 25th.  All
thoughts on the matter are welcome.

794,"Following are two issues that are currently being debated to which I am 
requesting feedback in order to submit an Enron position prior to the 
Steering Committee being held this week.  

Planning:  Parties are lobbying language to disclose all planning projects 
permitting anyone to join provided the interested party pays the incremental 
cost i.e. TO #1 wants to build a 2000 MW Kv line and maintain rights to all 
2000 MW, TO #2 wants to increase the lines capability by 400 MW and retain 
rights to all 400 MW.  In this scenario, TO #2 would have to pay all costs 
associated with upgrading the line.  The argument is that in an RTO world 
this scenario is irrelevant, however, I see this as a potential seams issue.

ADR:  Parties are lobbying to change language from mandatory binding 
arbitration with limited appeal to FERC TO mandatory binding arbitration only 
if both parties agree with the ability to bypass and go directly to FERC.  
(All entities with the exception of SWRTA currently enforce the former.  
SWRTA additionally has a provision that calls for a pre-arbitration peer 
review.)

FYI:  Class definitions are such that WAPA qualifies for membership in only 
one class and the regions do not fit the affiliate definition.  Therefore, if 
each region wants to join and have one vote per region in said class, they 
must each pay $5000 and the larger entity must pay the net energy to load 
ratio of total load with the larger region collecting pro rata compensation 
from the other regions.

Any comments you have are appreciated.

Subject: VMS Project Next Steps

All,

It has been a very successful year for the Enron / Razorfish VMS project 
Team.  We have been developing a Direct Access Power Market, user managed, 
tariff based calculation engine and customer expense / revenue allocation 
application.

The efforts which have taken place to date will benefit each of us as we move 
forward into these deregulated Direct Access markets.  The current 
application has gone through the following evolution:

Project Definition & Design documentation
Database Design / Development
User Interface Design / Development
Communication layer (COM) Design / Development
Hardware requisition / Implementation (Development / Test / Production)
Arthur Anderson Audit (Passed Audit review - Application meets all minimum 
requirements)
The Major Functionality / Action Items which have been delivered to date:
Security Management (Only IT Resources to have access)
Event / Task Management & Reporting
Component / Equations Management & Reporting
Estimation Generation Management & Reporting
Counter Party Profile Management & Reporting
Settlement Entity Profile Management & Reporting
Deal-Upload Management & Reporting
Integrated Dispute Management & Reporting
Customer Generation Charge Profile & Reporting
Historical Data Conversion mechanism
95 % of Calculation Engine Original Functional Requirements

The Major Functionality which is under it's final steps of Development and 
User Test
Reconciliation (Exception Identification, Allocation & Reporting)
Settlement Entity - Settlement Statement / Invoice Parsing & Reporting
Remaining 5% of Calculation Engine Functionality

Over the past 12+ months a total of $3 MM dollars has been spend on VMS.  We 
are reaching the final phase of this project and I am not sensing that 
everyone is still on board with this being OUR (Enron) Volume Management 
strategic solutions for Direct Access Power Markets.

As of March 1, 2001 we no longer have a contract in place with Razorfish.  
Razorfish has provided six developers dedicated to assist the Enron Networks 
IT staff in delivering the VMS solution over the past year.  These resources 
have been key in helping us get to where we are today.  In addition we had 
originally planned to retain these resources over the remainder of 2001 
(03/2001 - 12/2001) to assist with the implementation of VMS on the West & 
East Desk and in the Toronto Canada office.  Without a contract in place and 
currently working on good faith.  The project has come to a serious point of 
action.  Razorfish is asking for a total of $728,000 for services rendered 
between 3/1/2001 and 6/30/2001.  They will keep the resources dedicated to 
the project and will deliver the following:
Finalise base product development, assist in unit / user testing and 
Implement base VMS Product in Production.
Application Production Support for 30 Days post Implementation
Transition of knowledge base from Razorfish resources to Enron Networks IT 
resources

Razorfish is willing to discuss terms to assist Enron throughout the 
remainder of the year.  However,  I don't feel that everyone is ready to make 
that decision.  We do however need to make a final decision on this first 
implementation.

As I have stated prior in this document,  ""We have accomplished a lot over 
the past year.""  Without the continued assistance from the Razorfish portion 
of the VMS team.  I don't see any of us meeting our 2001 Volume Management 
(VM) Direct Access Power Market objectives in a more efficient or economical 
fashion.  In some cases I don't see it being possible at all.

It is time to make a decision.  Do we all agree that we need to move forward 
and retain Razorfish services for the additional $728,000 and incur each of 
OUR allocation of the over all VMS capitalised project total cost or do we 
stop where we are and find other solution to address our needs and debate 
over who was in agreement in the beginning of the project in order to 
determine who picks up the $3 MM already spent.

Please provide me with your response by 5:00 PM PT to allow me to get back to 
Razorfish with a well deserved response by Friday.

Thanks - MO

To my knowledge, Brent does not work for me.  I don't believe it would be 
consistent with Enron Corp's policy to have a lawyer working for the business 
developer. ECT Legal and EI Legal need to get together to decide who Brent 
should be reporting to, but I can assure you it should not be me.  This is a 
seperate issue from who is covering Brent's costs.  I do believe he is under 
the Argentine office's cost center since he is dedicating 100% of his time 
here.  This is consistent with EISC's policy of allocating legal costs out to 
the business unit that is incurring the cost.  However, I have had no input 
into Brent's compensation or bonus and believe he considers himself to be 
reporting to ECT Legal.

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

UK: Enron to shed metals staff, part of wider cuts.
By Andy Blamey

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Commodities trader Enron Metals plans to shed jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme which should see the Enron Group cut 250 to 500 European jobs in total, the company said. 
""We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between five and 10 percent,"" John Sherriff, president and CEO of Enron Europe, said in a statement.
Enron Metals employees in London were told at a meeting on Tuesday that staff cuts of 10 percent to 20 percent would be required, trade sources said. 
The company is seeking volunteers to take redundancy, but if sufficient voluntary slots have not been filled by a deadline of October 19, Enron will opt for compulsory cuts, they added. 
An Enron spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the official statement. 
""Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth,"" Sherriff said in the statement. 
""It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use to ensure that they are deployed in a way which will maximise earnings,"" he added. 
Market sources were not surprised by the move, citing testing conditions facing the metals trading sector as a whole. 
""At the moment you have low volumes of customer interest combined with difficult trading conditions and high operating costs,"" said one. 
""Even if they're making money from EnronOnline, they've got far too many people there."" 
U.S.-based Enron Corp became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London which had previously absorbed fellow LME ring-dealers Rudolf Wolff & Co and Billiton Metals Ltd. 
The number of LME ring dealers trading on the exchange's open-outcry floor has dwindled from a peak of 30 in the mid-1980s to the current 12. 
This could drop to 11 this week if ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , exits floor trading from Friday. 
In an interview with Reuters in August, Enron Metals President Joe Gold reiterated the company's commitment to the LME ring. 
""We send our No 1 trader and No 2 trader down on the (LME) floor every day, which is not a statement everyone can make. Wherever the most trading is during that day, that's where we'll be,"" Gold said. 
SCREEN TRADING 
Enron has also become a major player in metals screen trading since July last year, when the company announced the first physical metals transaction on its internet trading platform EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com). 
The system differs from the screen trading systems operated by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and UK-based metals and energy broker Spectron in that the trading platform is open to a broad range of users but Enron is the sole counter-party in each transaction. 
At the end of August the company amended EnronOnline to make markets for selected clients only in three months copper and aluminium for maximum 200-lot transactions, compared with the standard 20-lot markets on the system. 
In addition to metals, EnronOnline trades a range of products, from oil to plastics and emission allowances to credit derivatives. Enron announced the one millionth transaction on the system in May of this year.

Enron Plans to Trim as Many as 500 Jobs in Europe (Update2)

Enron Plans to Trim as Many as 500 Jobs in Europe (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, plans to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in Europe,
or as much as 10 percent of the workforce there, to reduce costs
and boost profit.

     The company has 5,000 workers in Europe, and it plans to trim
jobs by 5 percent to 10 percent, Enron said in a statement. The
company wants to make reductions through ``voluntary severance,''
the statement said.

     Houston-based Enron expanded European commodities trading in
2000 when it bought London-based MG Plc, the largest copper
marketer, for $448 million. Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned as
Enron's chief executive in August, told investors in July to
expect ``great things from Europe in the future.''

     ``There is still a lot of growth for them in Europe,'' said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. ``They're not
giving up, they're just taking an analysis of each unit.''

Gagliardi doesn't own Enron shares. John S. Herold doesn't issue
investment recommendations.

     Enron Europe is based in London and has offices in nine other
countries. Along with trading, it has interests in power plants in
Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the U.K. It didn't say where the
job cuts would be.

     Shares of Enron rose $1.81 to $35.20. They have fallen 58
percent this year.



Northeast Officials Seek Delay In Unifying Power Market
By Kristen McNamara
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Officials in Maryland and New York have urged federal energy regulators to slow down plans to merge the three existing wholesale power markets along the Eastern Seaboard into a single market for the entire Northeast. 
Citing concerns that rushing to consolidate the markets could create instability, reduce liquidity and inflate prices, the New York Independent System Operator and the Maryland Public Service Commission have separately asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study its plan before implementing it.
""There's no need to do this in a hasty manner,"" said Steve Sullivan, spokesman for the New York ISO, which runs that state's power market and transmission system. ""Our markets are not broken."" 
FERC is pushing utilities across the country to put their high-voltage transmission systems - the wholesale power market's equivalent of the interstate highway system - under the control of independent regional operators. The commission says the handoff is critical to the establishment of competitive power markets, as utilities with positions in the market are seen as unlikely to allow competitors equal access to the grid. 
Power traders like Enron Corp. (ENE) support the effort, while some utilities and state regulators have opposed the assertion of federal authority. 
In an effort to jump-start the sluggish process, FERC has outlined a plan to divide up control of the country's power grids among four regional operators - one each in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West. 
But while utilities still control much of the grid elsewhere in the country, transmission systems in the Northeast are already run by three independent wholesale market operators. FERC has told those operators to merge, and has indicated a preference for modeling the new market on that run by Mid-Atlantic operator PJM Interconnection LLC. 
A unified Northeast power market would be the world's largest - processing $9 billion in energy sales a year, handling 110,000 megawatts of electricity and serving a population of 54 million, according to the New York ISO. 
Seeking Other Options 

The Maryland Public Service Commission, along with regulators from Virginia and the District of Columbia, filed motions in August to stay FERC's order, saying the commission had overstepped its authority. 
The Maryland regulators will ask a federal court to block FERC if it moves forward with its plans to consolidate the three market operators - New York ISO, ISO New England Inc. and PJM - said Robert Harris, the commission's assistant manager of external affairs. 
The commission last week asked U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski. D-Md., to require FERC to explore options to ease the flow of power between markets short of a forced consolidation. 
""This proposal is unnecessary, reckless and risky,"" the PSC wrote. 
The PSC held public hearings on a unified Northeast power market Oct. 3 and 4, and plans to send the comments it received to FERC next week. 
The New York ISO and ISO New England said they aren't opposed to a consolidated market, as long as it incorporates the best practices from each of the three existing markets. 
The New York ISO, along with ISO New England, also wants each of the three regional markets to have equal representation on the board governing the merged market. 
New York's market operator also questioned whether centralizing control of a Northeast power market with one operator in one location would increase its vulnerability to electronic or other attacks by terrorists. 
FERC will hold a series of workshops next week to discuss issues related to the development of independent transmission operators across the country, including the need to clear bottlenecks and guard against attempts to manipulate the market. 
As reported, new FERC Chairman Pat Wood III said the commission will spend a day listening to the concerns of state regulators. The commission has also agreed to study its contention that consolidating markets will pay off for consumers, Wood said. 
Mirant Corp. (MIR) recently commissioned a study that showed a combined Northeast power market could save consumers $440 million a year.

INDIA: Reliance plan could sour BG's Indian deal.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 10 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd wants to become the operator of three oil and gas fields off the country's west coast, complicating U.K.-based BG Plc's proposed acquisition of a 30 percent stake in the fields, an industry source told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Reliance, which owns a 30 percent stake in the fields, has applied to the government to be appointed the operator, said the source, who declined to be identified.
That could potentially derail the deal BG announced last week to buy U.S.-based Enron Corp's 30 percent stake in the offshore Indian energy fields for $388 million. 
Numerous reports in the Indian media have said that the deal may be contingent on operatorship of the fields being transferred from Enron, the current operator, to BG. 
A spokesman for BG in London said on Wednesday that the company was ""continuing discussions with the other parties"" and until the matter was resolved, it had no further comment to make. 
Indian state-run driller ONGC, which owns the remaining 40 percent stake in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields, has already said it wants to take over the operatorship. 
The source said Reliance Industries, India's leading petrochemicals maker and flagship company of the country's largest business group, is also pursuing management control. 
Panna, Mukta and Tapti lie off India's western coast, and are considered among the more promising recent finds in the country. 
Panna and Mukta produce 29,000 barrels of oil and 2.5 million cubic metres of gas per day. 
The Mukta field produced 1,974 million cubic metres of gas in the year ended March 2001. 
BG said it wants a stake in the fields to complement its Indian interests in gas distribution and liquefied natural gas (LNG). 
Enron wants to leave the venture as a part of its move to focus on the high-growth energy trading business.

USA: El Paso shares advance after favorable ruling.

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A favorable regulatory ruling sent El Paso Corp's undervalued shares soaring on Wednesday, leading the utility group higher in morning trading. 
After the close of trading Tuesday, a U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission law judge ruled there was no clear evidence that El Paso exercised market power in an attempt to raise California natural gas prices and recommended dismissal of the issue in the case pending before the full commission.
This was ""not a clean sweep"" for the big gas pipeline company, UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said, noting Judge Wagner believes there was affiliate abuse - or collusion - between El Paso's pipeline and marketing segments during California's power crisis late last year and early this year. 
But Barone believes ""the net outcome from his decisions are a substantial positive for El Paso and have significantly reduced the company's limited exposure to this highly politicized California mess."" 
In active morning trading, El Paso shares traded between $51 and $51.69 - their best prices since Sept. 17, the first day of trading following the interruption caused by the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. 
After two hours, El Paso was up $2.50, or 5.13 percent, to $51.25 on composite trading of 1.8 million shares. 
Following it higher were the stocks of several other companies that had dropped on news of California's problems - Calpine Corp. , up 4.14 percent; Enron Corp. , up 3.26 percent, and Dynegy Inc. , up 2.4 percent.

UK: UPDATE 1-ScotiaMocatta seen to axe LME ring trade from Friday.
By Martin Hayes

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - London Metal Exchange (LME) ring-dealer ScotiaMocatta Metals is to scale back its operations, and will no longer execute business on the market's open-outcry floor after Friday, trade sources said on Wednesday. 
ScotiaMocatta is a unit of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , who informed metal traders of the move at a meeting held yesterday in the LME trader's London offices. Voluntary redundancies were also asked for, sources at the meeting said.
""They said they are restructuring the business, and will no longer execute trades on the floor after Friday,"" one said. 
This implies that ScotiaMocatta, which is one of 12 ring-dealing members (RDMs) on the LME, could relinquish this status, although sources at the meeting said this was not made clear. 
No-one from ScotiaMocatta in London was available to comment on Wednesday. 
Separately, Enron Group said its commodities trader Enron Metals would also lose jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme. 
On Tuesday, Bank of Nova Scotia said in Toronto it was scaling back its base metals trading desk and laying off traders, transforming ScotiaMoccata into a ""niche player"", due to the economic downturn. 
The bank said the decision does not affect its precious metals division. 
Bank of Nova Scotia purchased Mocatta Metals as it was known in September 1997. It is also one of the five members of the twice-daily London gold fix - it is the oldest bullion dealing house in the world, dating back to 1671. 
""We are still staying in the base metals business, but it will be more focused as a niche player in structural products,"" Scotiabank spokeswoman, Diane Flanagan told Reuters in Toronto. 
Flanagan confirmed there would be layoffs at the bank's base metals desk, but refused to say how many employees would be affected. 
If ScotiaMoccatta were to give up RDM status, it would bring LME ring-dealing numbers down to 11. The RDMs are the only firms entitled to trade on the open-outcry floor. 
In the LME's tiered membership, associate broker clearing members (ABCMs) are the second tier of membership - they have all the rights and privileges of LME membership, but cannot trade during the open-outcry trading sessions. 
LME director of corporate affairs Jonathan Haslam said on Wednesday that any announcement about a firm's membership status would have to come from the company concerned. 
DOWNTURN IN METALS BUSINESS HITTING HARD 
Trading conditions in base metals have deteriorated this year, with prices, volumes and revenues all falling, against a background of a global economic slowdown, worsened by the September 11 attacks on the U.S. 
This climate has hit all trading companies, and ScotiaMocatta's business has declined markedly, sources said. 
""They have gone from a position of being on the acquisition front to becoming a niche player. That highlights the way their business has declined in the last six months,"" a source close to the company said. 
There had been persistent talk that ScotiaMoccata had been looking to acquire other LME RDMs. In 2000, it sought to buy RDM Rudolf Wolff, a unit of Canada's Noranda. Wolff was eventually purchased by MG Trading, now known as Enron Metals 
This year it was said to be negotiating to buy another RDM, although that ultimately came to nothing. 
LME RING DEALING NUMBERS CONTINUE TO FALL 
LME ring-dealership numbers have declined since the mid-1980s, when there were some 30 companies on the floor. This is partly due to consolidation, but also due to some firms relinquishing their status in the wake of the Sumitomo Corp copper scandal in 1996. 
Now, there are significantly more ABCMs and the trend towards consolidation and contraction is likely to continue, as their costs are much lower than being a ring-dealer. 
To run a floor operation, with telecommunications and associated staff charges, probably costs between one and two million stg a year.

LOCAL
UNDERSEA PIPELINE PLAN FACES SCRUTINY ; HEARING SLATED ON ENRON PLAN TO IMPORT GAS
David Fleshler Staff Writer

10/10/2001
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
Broward Metro
1B
(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

State environmental regulators have raised sharp questions about Enron Corp.'s plans to construct an undersea natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to South Florida. 
The pipeline would threaten coral reefs, travel through a popular state park and face a series of hazards in the commercial bustle of Port Everglades, according to a memorandum by the Department of Environmental Protection's southeast district staff.
The Houston-based company wants to bring natural gas from a plant in Freeport, Grand Bahama, to Fort Lauderdale. With more gas-fueled power plants in the works, the company thinks it would find a market in Florida. 
El Paso Corp. and AES Corp. also have proposed undersea pipeline projects, although Enron's Calypso project has moved the furthest in the approval process. Judging from the state's comments on Enron's proposal, all three projects will face difficult questions over their safety and environmental impact. 
Just before it reaches land, for example, the pipeline would pass through Port Everglades, a busy center of commerce that could be full of peril for a high-pressure gas pipeline. 
""The pipeline will be routed through an area that has experienced chronic disturbances such as dredging, ship groundings, high ship traffic entering and leaving Port Everglades and storm events,"" states the memo, prepared by Jayne Bergstrom, an environmental specialist who prepared a series of questions for the company. 
""Large vessels have caused significant damage to Broward County reefs in recent years, including a 506-foot cargo ship, a freighter driven ashore during a February 1998 storm, a 348-foot Panamanian vessel that washed ashore a month later, and incredibly, a 360-foot nuclear-powered sub, the USS Memphis, in February 1993. Is this the safest route for a high-pressure gas pipeline?"" 
Enron spokesman John Ambler said the pipeline probably would be 30 to 40 feet below the sea floor in the port, well protected even if a ship sank or ran aground directly over it. Just outside the port, the pipeline would ascend to 3 feet below the floor, but that would be in a rocky area that's closed to ships, he said. 
""We're in the process of developing a response to all of these questions,"" he said. ""We're in an ongoing dialogue, and we're optimistic about being able to resolve these concerns in a way that will allow the project to move forward."" 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct a public hearing tonight on the environmental impact of the Enron project. The public will be allowed to make comments or ask questions of the agency's staff. 
The meeting will be at 7 p.m. at the I.T. Parker Community Center, 901 NE Third St., Dania Beach. 
As the pipeline approaches Broward County's coastline, it would pass through bands of coral reefs, important habitats for marine life. The company plans to drill horizontally under the reefs to avoid harming them. But it also would drag pipes over them in two areas before inserting them through the holes, according to the state. 
""Coral reefs deserve protection for their intrinsic natural value,"" the memo states. ""In addition, the economic, tourism, fishing and recreational resources of South Florida depend on healthy coral reef ecosystems. Calypso staff and engineers have not sufficiently demonstrated to staff that the project cannot be redesigned to avoid sensitive marine resources."" 
While the company has stated that the impact would be both temporary and insignificant, the memo states that the company has not explained how this could be so. The state estimated that the project would have an impact on about 15 acres of coral reefs and adjacent habitats. 
Given the damage the reefs already have suffered from pollution and other sources, the memo questions whether any pipelines should be routed directly to southeast Florida. Instead, it says it may be better to route them to the north, through areas without reefs, then connect to the pipeline system on land. 
Ambler said that the company was trying to find ways to avoid dragging the pipes along the reefs. 
All three pipeline projects will be reviewed by a series of federal, state and local agencies. 
David Fleshler can be reached at dfleshler@sun-sentinel.com or 954- 356-4535.

Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan
2001-10-10 11:34 (New York)

Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan

     Mumbai, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd.,
India's biggest private company, said it claimed the right to run
three offshore oil and gas projects, challenging a bid from the
U.K.'s BG Group Plc.

     BG has said a plan to buy out Enron Corp.'s 30 percent of the
projects is contingent on winning the right to oversee the
developments. Reliance and Oil & Natural Gas Corp., India's
biggest oil producer, together own 70 percent of the exploration
company and have an option to decide the operator after Enron
quits, Reliance spokesman Yogesh Desai said.

     The purchase would gave BG a 30 percent stake in the Tapti
and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63 percent of an
untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The assets hold more
than 170 million barrels of oil and gas. BG declined to comment.

     BG will invest ``hundreds of millions'' of dollars to double
production in the Tapti field by 2004 if the other two partners in
the venture contribute as well, Nigel Shaw, chief executive
officer of BG India Pvt. told reporters last week. ONGC has
already claimed its right to operate the fields.

     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian
venture partners, ONGS and Reliance, as well as from the nation's
biggest refiner, Indian Oil Corp.

     India's gas production fell 11 percent to 1999 from 1997 as
Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the state explorer, made no significant
discoveries in 15 years. Insufficient supplies of gas have hurt
growth in the country's fertilizer and chemicals industries and
hampered upgrading of its power plants, still mostly coal-fed.

     The government expects a gas deficit to triple in the next
six years unless new wells are drilled or existing fields expand
sales.

     Domestic bureaucracy has already thwarted efforts in India by
Electricite de France and Cogetrix Energy Inc., which have pulled
out, while Enron is locked in a price dispute with authorities.
The government is the sole buyer of gas and power from producers
and the sole seller to distributors.


LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)

LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)


     (Adds bank quotes in second, fifth paragraphs.)

     London, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- The London Metal Exchange said
Scotiamocatta, a metals-trading unit of the Bank of Nova Scotia,
will cease open-outcry transactions on the LME floor.

     It was not immediately clear when the company will end floor
trading, said Caoimhe Buckley, a spokeswoman for the exchange, the
world's biggest metals-trading bourse. The bank is planning to cut
about 20 base metals staff in London, said Pam Agnew, a
spokeswoman in Toronto, though its floor dealing is unaffected for
now. ``At this time, it's business as usual,'' she said.

     Scotiamocatta is the latest defection from the LME, whose
number of floor traders has more than halved to 11 in the past
decade because of declining margins. This year, the price of
copper has dropped 23 percent and aluminum has declined 17 percent
as slowing economies cut demand and reduce trading commissions.

     ``It detracts from (the LME's) standing as a marketplace
because it's another one gone,'' said Richard Starsmeare, head of
commodity and trade finance at Raiffeisen Zentralbank in London.

     The bank's decision to cut its London metals staff is related
to the ``downturn in the economy,'' Agnew said.

     The LME's director of corporate affairs, Jonathan Haslam,
later said the exchange couldn't officially comment on
Scotiamocatta's role at the exchange.

     ``The LME wishes to make clear that it has made no formal
statement about the position of the Bank of Nova Scotia,'' Haslam
said in a statement. ``Any statements about their future trading
must come from them.''

     The LME's other floor-trading members, or ``ring dealers''
include Enron Metals Ltd. and Refco Overseas Ltd.


Bin Laden 'look alike' arrested in India
BBC News
October 9, 2001
By Frances Harrison in Delhi 
Indian police detained a bearded man in the western border area of Rajasthan on suspicion that he might be the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. 
The man was released after two hours of questioning which established that he was in fact a Hindu and also worked for an American company. 
Police in the town of Jaisalmer bordering Pakistan said they saw a man with a flowing beard and black scarf driving along the national highway in a jeep. 
They chased the man, took him to the police station and politely asked who he was - clearly concerned they might have apprehended Osama Bin Laden fleeing Aghanistan via Pakistan. 
US company 
The bearded man told the police he was an engineer working with the American company Enron on a wind energy project in the area. 
A telephone call to the company confirmed this and one policeman told the man that he should be thankful he wasn't living in the United States because he would have definitely been shot so strong was his resemblance to Osama Bin Laden. 
The man, who turned out to be a Hindu and not a Muslim, was freed immediately. 
But not before a crowd of curious villagers had gathered outside the police station eager to catch a glimpse of the man who's been dominating the news.

RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 2/23


RECENT EVENTS:

-- The week started off on a very positive note.  Monday was a holiday!
Tuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with last
minute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills.

-- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee.  This
measure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facility
as a public utility subject to the state,s jurisdiction.  The bill also
places the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages for
generation units.  Although the bill goes much further, the author,s only
intention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages,
but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manner
outlined in the bill.  IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end along
with CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the California
Cogeneration Council.  The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill.
Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to the
opposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen.  The message from
the opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as it
passed out of the committee on a party-line vote.  IEP is currently
reassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not the
only bill that proposes similar changes.

-- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne,
was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills.  The first was AB 34x (La
Suer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, including
some IEP-sponsored language.  IEP has a support if amended position on the
bill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable.  Last
minute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone a
hearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26).  However, because the Keeley
amendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill,
La Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committee
analysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its current
form.

AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committee
with only one &no8 vote.  AB 36x would provide expedited siting for a
repower project, as defined.  However, despite IEP,s efforts to get the bill
amended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects.  The
author has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental community
and the CEC to develop language that works for everyone.  IEP,s major issue
at this point is that is should actually work.  The measure was double
referred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will be
heard there next.

-- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x
(Battin).  All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for the
measure.  IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizing
members on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure in
the Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing.  Both SCE
and WSPA also have some outstanding issues, but only WSPA so far will be
opposing the bill.

-- SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and financing
authority, passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed to
the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next. IEP met with
Senator Burton,s staff this week to talk about amendments to SB 6x relating
to limiting the Authority,s eminent domain powers.  Staff was open to what
we had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will move
forward with the bill.  Regardless, IEP will continue to push for amendments
on the Assembly side.

-- SB 33x (Burton), which would require the Governor,s plan to purchase the
IOU,s transmission to be approved first by the Legislature, is still
awaiting consideration on the Senate floor.

-- The Governor had another press conference today to provide a status on
the negotiations between the state and the three IOUs regarding the purchase
of the utilities, transmission system.  Reuters is saying there the Governor
has a deal with SCE to purchase its share of the power grid for $2.76
billion.  Negotiations are still going on with PG&E and SDG&E.  More
information on press conference can be found on the Governor,s web site.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report which includes
all the special session bills introduced through yesterday.  Please let me
know if you need copies of any of these bills.

808,"Walter Mitty (wol-tuhr MIT-ee) noun

   An ordinary, often ineffectual person who indulges in fantastic
   daydreams of personal triumphs.

[After the main character in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by
James Thurber.]

   ""The men you see rolling over the zoysia at 5 miles per hour are
   pretending to be Mario Andretti at Indianapolis. Nothing draws
   Walter Mitty from a soul like the sound of a riding lawn mower

One of the most important ingredients of fiction is its characters. Think
of any memorable book, play or movie and you'll recall its people--from
protagonist (and deuteragonist and tritagonist and ...) to antagonist are
folks one can feel, relate to, though not necessarily always agree with.
These are the people with depths, they are not cardboard characters or
people who live a 2D life, to use the publishing jargon. These multifaceted
people come alive on the pages of a book, on the stage of a theater, or on
the screen of a movie theater with all their foibles, follies and victories.
Perhaps the ultimate sign of their character is that they live on on the
pages of dictionaries. This week's AWAD focuses on a few of these fictional
persons who came alive and added a bit more color to our language.     -Anu

Carol, I'd like to speak with you regarding the following structure proposed 
by Sorema, which address the fact that they can't sell/buy derivatives and 
can't reinsure any contract governed by NY law.  The credit issue 
remains--they propose solving it by means of an assignment clause.

Sorema did six deals with us last year using Palladium.

812,"? There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat 
Senator Burton (D-San Francisco), President Pro Tem.   Even though the 
chances of this happening are relatively low, John Bryson, CEO of SoCal, with 
the support of the Governor, are making huge efforts to oust Burton and 
replace him with one of two potential candidates - Richard Alarcon (D-San 
Fernando Valley), Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl (D-Los Angeles).  Alarcon has 
already stated that he would not accept the position.  However, at minimum, 
Bryson, Governor Davis and/or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink 
his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout.
? Additionally, behind the scenes, things are looking very grim for 
California due the implications of Direct Access.  The biggest opponent of 
Direct Access comes from the Governor's office as they realize the potential 
effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream 
supporting the bond issuance.

What's It Worth To You?

Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.
- Oscar Wilde

Certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products - products that avoid the acid rain, smog, global warming, and soot pollution caused by mainly coal-burning power plants. Perhaps with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year, the Duquesne Light service territory will be the first market where both price and value of renewable energy are understood and motivate large numbers of customers to buy (see case studies that follow).

Moreover, a new study published in the August 24, 2001 edition of Science, by Mark Z. Jacobson and Gilbert M. Masters of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, shows that the ""cost gap"" between coal power and the cheapest forms of renewable energy is narrowing sharply, down to about 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Most importantly, professors Jacobson and Masters document that the apparently slightly lower cost of coal generation is more illusion than reality, due to its real costs.

When coal generation's environmental and health costs like damage to air, water and forests, as well as human illness and death, are included in the calculation, coal generation's real price jumps to about 5.5 cents to 8.3 cents per kWh. By comparison, the 4.0 cents to 5.0 cents cost of wind energy makes it a bargain. 

""Wind energy is unequivocally less expensive than is coal energy,"" say Jacobson and Masters.

How Much Is That Kilowatt-Hour?
It's not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still don't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage. 

Yet lack of knowledge goes beyond value in electricity markets. Consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything. 

Even sophisticated observers don't know the price of comparative products, regardless of the added environmental and public health costs. Price transparency is a bad joke, because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in Houston.

In those states that allow customers to choose a generation supplier, few consumers and policymakers know what their local utility charged for generation prior to competition, including what are now called stranded costs. Perhaps even fewer know how prices alone, not including the stranded cost charges, of today's competitive products compare to their utilities' unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition. Or how today's renewable energy prices compare to utilities' pre-competition generation rates. 

And how many know how today's price to compare or default rate compares to the pre-competition, monopoly generation rate (which includes stranded costs)? Confusion on these basic questions is widespread and distorts perception and policy. 

It is vital for policymakers to know the answers in order to formulate wise policy (see for answers, ""It's All in the Numbers,"" E3, Vol. 3 No. 12). But even that's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity: ""What is it worth?"" 

An important change that will affect the answer is on the horizon. Beginning in February, 2002, stranded cost charges will be eliminated from electric bills in the Pittsburgh area. These are payments made to Duquesne, primarily to cover its prior investments in uneconomic, nuclear generation, recovered from consumers through the Competitive Transition Charge (CTC).

The following examples of typical types of customer bills in the Duquesne Light territory illustrate comparative prices at pre-restructuring or present default rates, the new default rates that will take effect next year, and for various renewable energy products. 

These examples will hopefully clear away some of the haze surrounding the true price of renewable products.

Residential Customers
A typical residential customer (rate RS) using 600 kWh per month has been paying Duquesne Light about $75 per month since rates were capped in 1996. Of this monthly $75 bill, about $48 is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services.

In turn, more than $20 of the $48 total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges. Since customer choice began, all 600 kWh residential customers - including those choosing a competitive supplier - have had to pay Duquesne the same $20 for stranded costs. If customers were not required to pay Duquesne for its stranded costs, this typical customer's total bill would be less than $55, a whopping 27 percent less than it is now.

As a result of stranded cost charges, customers choosing a competitive supplier can only avoid paying Duquesne about $28 of its $48 generation rate, where the $28 reflects the ""shopping credit"" or price to compare that has been available. So, only if a customer could buy 600 kWh per month for less than $28, including transmission, would s/he save money by switching to a competitive supplier. 

As you can see, stranded cost charges and the weird economics and pricing they produce make it difficult to know the price of electricity, let alone the value of renewable generation. 

If our typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today for 6.0 cents/kWh, the consumer would pay $36 for generation - $12 per month less than the historic regulated generation rate of $48. At a rate of 7.0 cents/kWh, the same consumer would pay $42 for renewable generation, or $6 per month less. The price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents/kWh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power. 

There are presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products in Duquesne's territory (three are Green-e certified), for prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 7.0 cents/kWh. Renewable generation today costs substantially less than coal and nuclear generation did prior to competition. Yet, the $20 stranded cost charge that a 600 kWh renewable energy residential customer must pay in the Duquesne service territory has concealed not just the value of renewable energy, but also its real price. 

Until February, a customer buying renewable generation for 7.0 cents/kWh - or $6 less than the pre-competition rate - will still have a total bill, including CTCs and distribution charges, that is $12 more than their current bill. While many might find that $12 more per month for cleaner energy and its associated benefits is still reasonable, many more who are motivated by their wallets alone probably would not. But a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as CTCs in the Duquesne Light territory are about to be eliminated. 

While the Public Utility Commission still hasn't established what the new regulated rates will be, it appears that a typical 600 kWh per month customer who buys generation from Duquesne/Orion will receive a rate reduction of about 16 percent, saving about $12 per month. However, customers won't receive the full savings from the elimination of CTCs because a portion will cover the costs of Duquesne's integration into the PJM-West Independent System Operator.

But as soon as the stranded cost charges are removed, a typical residential consumer could buy renewable energy products and pay less than what s/he paid for electricity under default rates, and less than s/he paid in 1996. Both the price and value will then be motivating factors for buying renewable energy.

When the CTC is removed, the residential customer using 600 kWh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve one-third of his/her load - for a total of $68, or a savings of $7 compared to today's default rate. Even if the customer were to buy all of his/her electricity from one of the new wind farms being built in southwestern Pennsylvania, the customer would pay less than $3 more per month than s/he is currently paying for default generation.

If the customer chooses a blended product with both renewable and non-renewable content for 6.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill would be $5 less than what it is today. Even at a price of 7.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill for a blended product would be less than $1 per month more, or only about $8 more per year, than the price currently paid for default service of mostly nuclear and dirty coal-generated power.

The end of CTCs in Duquesne's territory will allow a residential customer to switch from traditional, dirty generation to renewable generation and still save money, or pay only pennies more.

Business and Institutional Customers
The dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher, but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets. For example, a small commercial customer on rate GS/M, such as a restaurant or convenience store, using 10,000 kWh per month and with a demand of 23 kW, has been paying $808.52 per month for regulated or default service. 

With elimination of the CTC and the PJM-West integration costs, their bills will likely decrease about 11 percent, for a total monthly bill of about $720, a savings of about $88 per month. A small commercial customer could use the savings to buy enough wind energy to meet 25 percent of its load - saving about $26 per month compared to present bills, and still paying less for electricity than in 1996.

A large commercial/industrial customer on rate GL, such as a large hotel, hospital or a small college or manufacturer, using 1.168 million kWh/month and a demand of 2,000 kW has been paying about $69,440 per month for regulated or default service. With elimination of the CTC, the bill will likely decrease about 8 percent beginning around September, 2002, for a total monthly bill of around $63,900; a savings of about $5,540 per month. 

Those substantial savings could then be invested in purchasing renewable energy without increasing electricity bills above either current or 1996 levels. For example, a hospital could serve 30 percent of its load with a blended product for 5.5 cents/kWh and still save about $1,225 per month compared to its current default bill. Two hospitals could purchase the entire output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to supply over 15 percent of their total electricity requirements and still save about $5,200 per month compared to their present bills. Even if a single hospital purchased the output of an entire wind turbine, enough to serve 31.4 percent of its load, the total additional cost of $3,209 per month would be only about $3,840 more per year than their current default bill.

For hospitals, which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coal-generated power every day, how much is that worth?

Municipal consumers on rate SM for street lighting, using 110,000 kWh per month, have been paying $33,130 per month for regulated and default electricity. With elimination of the CTC, the bill would decrease to $27,220, but with the PJM-West transition costs the bill may decrease about 14.5 percent, for a total monthly bill of $28,320; a savings of about $4,810 per month.  About three municipal customers with that consumption level could join together to purchase the output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to meet their entire electricity load and still save about $2,850 per month each, compared to their current default costs. A single municipal customer could still save about $880 per month compared to their current bill if they purchased a blended product at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

What *is* it worth?
What will renewable energy be worth to Pittsburgh's families, businesses, institutions and governments? Buying renewable is the single best thing any consumer can do to protect our environment and public health. Its value is great and its price in Pittsburgh will become less distorted with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year. The savings of $20 per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial, industrial, and municipal accounts, gives Pittsburgh a great opportunity to become America's first green-powered city. The price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in 1996 or even what many are paying now. 

The value of that opportunity is priceless.

817,"=DJ Enron Dn-3: Enron Hurting From Fears Of More Disclosures
2001-10-19 14:40 (New York)

  A.G. Edwards analyst Michael Heim also said Enron's  stock drop is ""probably
related to the articles that have been run in The Wall Street Journal."" 

  He said there is now a feeling within the financial community that there
might be more surprises and more charges from Enron on the horizon. Heim can't
remember more than general allusions to the LJM2 partnership in filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. There were no details as to the
quantity of the impact of transactions between Enron and the partnership, he
said. 

  ""I don't feel any certainty that there's not other similar problems that
might not be revealed,"" Heim said. 

  Credibility is particularly important for Enron, he said, because it is
difficult for analysts to model due to its tens of thousands of trading
contracts changing on a daily basis in oil, gas, power, coal, and other areas. 

  ""Companies like Enron rely a lot more on reputation than other companies
given the clandestine nature of its earnings,"" Heim said. But Enron has a
history of meeting its earnings guidance, which helps, he added. 

  A spokesperson at the company was not immediately available for comment. 

  While Heim is not totally convinced there won't be future charges that could
take a toll on Enron's balance sheet, he still thinks the severity of the stock
drop over the last few days might be overdone. 

  ""My gut feel is that the market has probably overreacted to this,"" he said.

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update2)
2001-10-19 14:40 (New York)

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update2)

     (Adds more businesses with Fastow ties in seventh paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen as much as 28 percent in the past three days on concern the
biggest energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its
chief financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Shares of Enron fell as much as 13 percent today. Enron's
board cost the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2
Co-Investment, partnerships that bought Enron assets, a
shareholder alleged Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $3.40 to $25.60 in midafternoon trading.
Earlier, the shares touched $25.15. They have fallen 67 percent in
the past 12 months, and 69 percent this year.

USA: Enron stock sustains further heavy losses.

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock sustained further heavy losses on Friday as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years. 
In early afternoon trading the energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent at $25.68 per share, making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million.
Analysts said investor confidence had been rattled by severalarticles in the Wall Street Journal this week alleging possible conflict of interest on the part of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. 
Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements, but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities. 
""For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already, these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors,"" said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. ""It points to poor decision-making on behalf of the board and top management at Enron,"" he said. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, was one of Wall Street's high flyers last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent. 
The stock's ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company's plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform. 
This year Enron's shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the Internet soured, new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after six months in the job and a power plant project in India became mired in a financial dispute. 
Moody's Investor Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after Enron took $1.01 billion in writedowns and charges, substantially reducing valuations for several non-core businesses including broadband and water services. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings.

my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side 
thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I 
have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

830,"Elizabeth,

Attached please find some contractual documents related to the Midwest ISO and our ability to take service under their OATT.  I need to have them reviewed as well as get some aid completing them.  I have attempted to complete as much of the documents as possible.

Can you please task someone to look at these as soon as possible?  The MISO is expected to start offering service on November 15.  Unfortunately, they have not given us a lot of lead time on this.  I have already been working with Ed Sacks and Leslie Reeves to deal with credit and billing issues, but now have collected much of the information and need to get the documents reviewed.

Thanks for your help.  One annoying problem with Sections 3-7 - they are in Adobe Acrobat, and can only be edited with Acrobat Writer.  I have tried getting the editable originals from MISO, but have not had a lot of luck.  I just placed another call to them to request them again.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Hi Stephanie,

Thank you very much for the update (scary as it sometimes sounds). I know you're swamped but if we could review and talk about a synopsis of the gas options on Friday it would be very helpful. I think that we should be prepared to talk to Chris and Jake early next week as it looks like a pretty high probability (assuming we can't get there with Puget, Mirant or Engage) that we may need to step up to the Expansion. 

Let us know what your schedule looks end of this week and early next. Thanks very much!

Subject:	Longview Transport Options

Spoke with Kern today - They are evaluating the economics of two expansion projects: Rockies to Stanfield (piggyback of displacement fix) and across the Gorge (Stanfield to I-5).  NWPL's least cost expansion of the Gorge is for roughly 55,000 mmbtu/day. At the present time, they plan to offer the cheap expansability to their existing shippers on June 20 as Phase II of the displacement fix. Existing customers will have 30 days to decide.

While NWPL remains undecided about the timing of an expansion out of the Rockies, the project has not yet disconnected from the displacement fix. Current best guess on economics (this is a moving target) for Rockies expansion is in the low $.50's plus $.40's for Gorge (and this excludes fuel).

Another option would be to use existing PGT capacity (or participate in their 6/19 binding open season) to Stanfield and participate only in the Gorge project.  If we were ready, we could force Kern into a Gorge expansion prior to June 20. To drive the process, we would need to be the anchor tennant and be subject to the outcome of an open season that could result in upward pressure on the rate.

I have asked Eric Moon to help analyze and map all of the options. Hope to have something to send to you on Friday.

"
836,"Herewith a few ideas for the October meeting in London, some of them
after checking with Paul Portney and with Pankaj. I offer these very, very
preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK
colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting
your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions.
I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening
dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the
facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip
for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative.
We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the
viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political
side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations
(characterized as ""a VERY smart guy on climate""):
Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC.  Has been on UK
climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful).
Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out;
big figure in Europe).
Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and
can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or
Brenton).
Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam
Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul
also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the
French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good
presenter and a good economist.
WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET
ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON
THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A
USEFUL TOPIC.
I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: ""I remember
promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be
interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council
about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly
on the Continent, to the U.S. model.  I got the following names from Jay
Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty
Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as
possibilities.  Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of
Henkel, very senior),  Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam
Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse
Coopers - would be the most junior of the three.  I don't personally know any
of the three.""
Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a
two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a
run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better
understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face.
1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great
interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We
might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if
allowed to do so.
2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above).
3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy.
4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk).
5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and
how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just
joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way.
6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If
this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers.
7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of
US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me,
we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and
the inventor of the ""climate change levy"" that is driving industry in this
country nuts.
Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with
Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum,
which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve
and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with
Ken at his convenience.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

wheezing economy will hardly slow it. In the past year,
business theory surrounding technology has been reinvented and
redefined multiple times. Check out the latest ""must-read""

Today's focus: Putting a lid on the penguin

By Phil Hochmuth

Since you can't have enough security these days, Linux users
may want to check out LIDS, an open source tool for locking
down their Linux-based file and Web servers.

The LIDS (Linux Intrusion Detection System) Project is an open
source development effort that has spawned some code that could
be useful in protecting Linux file systems from hackers and
keeping critical Linux applications from being compromised.

According to its creators, LIDS can be used to protect a Linux
server from attacks such as ""buffer overflow"" and ""string
format"" attacks, which are used to disrupt a Linux system's
software with a barrage of requests and gain access to the
server's system files or applications.

LIDS is a patch for Linux kernel v. 2.4.14 or earlier, and adds
security features such as access control lists, which bolster
existing Linux control mechanisms for authenticating users to a
system. It is also designed to protect files and processes from
being changed or deleted, even by users with ""root"" or
administrative level access to a Linux system.

LIDS adds a port scanner detector to a Linux kernel, which can
be configured to detect intruders by identifying patterns of
activity on certain server ports, such as port 80 (HTTP), and
notifying an administrator of such events. The system also can
keep a log file of rule violations and other unauthorized
access attempts on server resources. An administration tool
included in the LIDS software is used to set system rules and
to designate what files and processes to protect.

Subject: Dave Delainey's Additional Requests

As per the presentation with Dave yesterday and a follow up conversation with 
him today, we need the following:

Kate:   Run the model based on the ""break even cost #'s"" in comparison to 
GENCO's #'s assuming a 6 1/2% fixed interest 
  rate. (As per Dave Don Miller's GENCO group should be able to supply us 
with their comparable #'s).
 Also run the model based on MAIN and ECAR curves ( we have already run the 
#'s on Cinergy and West NY).   
 Produce a graph showing the different curves, including ICF-Kaiser.  
 Also show a graph comparing Moore's tariff build up (based on the 30 yr 
curve) for Fixed and Variable O&M,    principal, interest. etc.  (Jonathan 
Hoff should be of great help here).

Miguel:  Get market comps from the Confidential-CSFB study that Don Miller 
has giving Asset Pricing comps for Power   Plants (GENCO related).  Also look 
to get any other market/asset sales info. we showed to Orion.
 Meet with the desk to get the MAIN and ECAR curves Dave has requested we 
run. (for Kate's proforma).  
 Since Miguel is out after Thursday, Adam  should coordinate and follow up in 
Miguel's absence.

He also gave us go ahead for the DASH and RAROC. Kate was cleaning up the 
DASH and the model to pass on to  Underwriting.

Joe D. and Lisa B. are following up on the Syn. Lease structure getting with 
the banks.  

Eric will of course address all the other issues including technical, 
transmission interface, turbine purchase, permitting, etc.

As you know, Dave wanted this done in tandem with all the other development 
projects, which means ASAP.

Thanks, Thomas.

852,"Johnnie,

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen

CONFIDENTIAL, PRIVILEDGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT
COMMUNICATION...rob and bruce. i read yesterday the
erc of 1998 yesterday as well as the indian solicitors
opinions, and most of the regs. i am out of town for a
couple of days and i just wanted to give you my
reactions....1. i feel that we would not prevail on
our jurisdiction arguments were we before a u.s.
court. the law is too well established against us
here. i am coming from having been involved in both
the contract modification point in various fpc/ferc
cases including the order 380 cases that overturned
all the pipeline contracts and the gulf warranty/texas
eastern case that disregarded the arbitration
provision of the gulf warranty contract in favor of
fpc review. so i confess, i would be hard to convince.
2. we are positing a rather narrow interpretation of
the dispute resolution authority, e.g. no jurisdiction
for disputes between ""utilities"". will the h.c.
interpret the mrc for all future cases as withholding
jurisdiction or disputes between utilities? the point
of all this negativism is that we consider trying to
avoid the risk of an up or down decision by the h.c.
(obviously, we may not be able to do so and some
probably will not wish to do so), suggesting
alternatively to the court that it e.g. permit the ppa
arbitration to go forward, deferring to a future date
the jurisdiction determination. in one of our
discussions chris mentioned this as a strategy. there
are no doubt other imaginative options. i, of course,
defer to chris and the indian counsel, who believe
merc has no jurisdiction, but this regluatory issue is
new to them and old to u.s. public service companies
and me, so i would question them thoroughly to be sure
they have focussed on the risks. an adverse finding by
merc could effect our political risk coverage. we
might quietly ask our coverage expert how an adverse
merc finding on the misrep issue would effect our
protection. 3.  a couple of comments on today's
meeting...i am concerned that any hint or threat of a
lender liability claim would produce a claim against
us, not a valid one, but one we don't want. secondly i
would use bankrupcy as a last resort to save our
having to put more into the project. clearly others
know much better than i, but i don't see us salvaging
any equity money from a bankrupcy and i don't see the
indian courts or merc honoring a u.s. court order. for
whatever value or use, if any, they may be, these are
my views, which i reserve the right to change. jim

862,"Jeff,

As discussed yesterday, provided below is the note I mentioned.  Please call to discuss.  I would like to get this inter-company relationship agreed today.

Eric      x52711





In an effort to promote an internal operating business structure that maximizes the value opportunities for Enron in respect to European LNG activities, provided below is an agreed group interaction protocol.

Defined points of contact
LNG's European commercial lead:	Clay Harris
Continental Commercial Nat Gas lead:	Steve Sapling

Clay Harris and Steve Asplin shall meet at a minimum weekly to discuss current ongoing business and relevant future transaction prospects.  

Prospective transactions with existing European LNG Market Participants
The LNG group shall continue to advance the execution of Master LNG Purchase and Sales Agreements with these relevant European LNG players: Distrigas, Tractabel, GdF, Gas Natural, Repsol, Enagas, Botas, Enel, SNAM/ENI, Edison, Iberdrola, Union Fenosa, Endesa, etc.  Clay Harris and Steve Asplin will coordinate these activities, which will be further coordinated with the relevant EEL country representatives.  The LNG group shall always use Steve Asplin and these relationship managers to coordinate meetings to discuss LNG opportunities on a regional and global basis.  An invitation to join these meetings should and shall always be extended to both groups when LNG opportunities are to be discussed.  European ex-ship LNG transactions shall not require intermediation by the EEL nat gas trading desk. However, the LNG group shall always keep the relevant EEL trading desks aware of the proposed transactions in advance. 

LNG Sales into France and Belgium
The groups will maintain daily contact regarding prospective LNG terminal capacity positions and LNG sales.  The two group's main short term interaction objective shall be for the facilitation of market making for the prospective LNG deliveries by the LNG group.  An important factor that all parties must appreciate is that Enron's activities in Belgium are extremely sensitive to relationship issues with Distrigas.

LNG Sales into Spain
At this point in its development, the natural gas market in Spain is unique to other continental markets given the limited access to source pipelines and the significant market share of LNG.  As such, a coordinated effort to source, create and execute transactions is imperative for Enron's success.  To create an atmosphere of thorough communication, the EEL nat gas group will ensure that an invitation is extended to the LNG group for its gas marekting meetings and discussions, and that the LNG group is completely informed regarding potential transactions.  The LNG group will ensure that the EEL nat gas group is kept fully informed and included in potential sourcing activities.  The overriding goal shall be to ensure that transactions are completed that create the maximum possible value for Enron Corp.

Current Proposed Spanish Transaction
As discussed above, in order to capture the current prospective transaction opportunities in Spain, EEL and Global LNG have agreed to jointly take the proposed length position (0.7BCM/yr for 2 to 5 years) in Spain.  The P&L shall be managed on a complete open book basis (i.e. groups will exchange all relevant term sheets associated with LNG purchases, nat gas sales, re-gas and transit costs, and shipping).  Any margins generated shall be split between the groups.  Determination of the relevant margins shall take into account the market value of LNG groups prior existing LNG charter positions, as well as prior existing EEL  trading desk positions nat gas group.  

The final determination of the value split shall be made on a fully open book basis by Eric Gonzales and Eric Shaw.

kristen
"
876,"Since I did not get a chance to meet with you yesterday, I would like to lay 
out a few thoughts in this email:

1. Additional areas that might require immediate attention:

? Consider existing ""Bets"" and large positions already in the books and ways 
of adjusting these bets, if necessary (excluding CA):
  - NY: large short positions behind Central Hudson and ConEd (IBM deal and 
others)
  - Carolinas: Standard Offer timing (Springs, Eli Lily, others)
  - Illinois: concentration of short regulated positions

? Quick handle on option positions: do we need to switch customers in some 
areas? what options we ought to exercise tomorrow? next week? etc.
  - options embedded in the deals
  - regulatory switch options
  - retail index options
  - EAM options

? Managing value from restructuring legacy deals: in the process of reviewing 
the 13 deals, we discovered some provisions in the contracts that were not 
captured and managed properly - they might require immediate attention to 
minimize losses in these deals.

2. Managing Regulatory Exposure

? Approximately 80% of EES regulatory exposure is behind 40 utilities
? In the process of rate case decomposition, we need to identify the main 
components of each rate structure - create a rate case formula
? These components will fall into two categories: hedgeable (gas, coal, 
heating oil fuel costs, inflation, etc.) and ""unhedgeable"" (CTC timing, 
standard offer, etc.)

  Hedgeable Component      Unhedgeable Component
Strategy: Manage within the respective commodity books   Capitalize on 
portfolio diversification across the country
          Look for ""macro"" hedges and focus activities of EGA

Pricing:  You know best       Risk-based: higher premiums for greater 
uncertainty

Policy:  Internal authorizations only on who, how and when to hedge Develop a 
limit framework and propose a limit to the BOD

Exposure: Existing VaR model will suffice     Develop and implement stress 
scenarios to quantify exposure

3. Other Considerations

? Curve management: clear responsibilities, periodic review and validation
? Interaction with the EAM world: EAM projects create long positions, pricing 
bundled deals with an EAM component
? Flash-to-actual catch up: liquidations validate curve assumptions
? Attention to EES-Canada: currently executed a power deal and a few gas deals
? Process for pricing smaller mid-market deals: sacrificing quantity for 
quality - force originators to develop standard deal structures

I could elaborate further on these points. Vlady.

I've asked her every month or two what's cookin, but havn't gotten a good sense of any other action by us in recent months.

ComEd seeks rate hike for biz
Second proposal spurs opposition among regulators
Crain's -- October 15, 2001
By Steve Daniels <mailto:sdaniels@crain.com>
Commonwealth Edison Co. is pressing for another big hike in its charges for
delivering electricity to customers of rival power suppliers.

The Chicago utility's Aug. 31 filing with federal regulators to nearly
double transmission rates - for carrying electricity over its long-haul,
high-voltage lines for these customers - has triggered opposition from state
regulators.

That request followed a June proposal for a 37% increase in distribution
charges, for moving power through the utility's more local, lower-voltage
wires (Crain's, June 11). That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois
Commerce Commission (ICC).

If approved, the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and
distribution costs by about 50% for business customers that leave the
utility for competing power suppliers.

Perhaps more important, the new rates would clear the way for delivery
charge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicago-area power users in
three years, when a freeze on ComEd's rates expires.

Transmission and distribution rates account for 20% to 25% of a typical
business customer's total power bill - so, a typical bill could rise as much
as 10% with these increases.

Apart from the bottom-line hit to businesses, ComEd competitors and local
government officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent
competitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from
offering savings from the utility's bundled rate.

AES NewEnergy Inc., the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more
than 800 customers, says 86% of its customers will see their bills increase
if both proposals are approved.

""What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the
point where bundled (utility) service is cheaper, or it's so close that they
wouldn't bother choosing an (alternative) provider,"" says Philip O'Connor,
president of AES NewEnergy's Chicago office. ""You cannot have competition
being viable when your base of potential customers is so small.""

Arlene Juracek, ComEd vice-president of regulatory and strategic services,
counters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short
term because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a
corresponding decrease in ""transition"" fees paid to the utility when
customers use another supplier.

The Aug. 31 transmission rate proposal, filed with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission,
which asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike.

The latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEd's
account methodology, in which the utility would wipe off its books more than
$660 million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask
ratepayers to shoulder that investment again.

'Unjust and unreasonable'

In its filing with FERC, the ICC said the proposed change ""would result in
artificially high transmission rates, and an unjust and unreasonable
windfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers.""

""They're essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the
game,"" says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill.

ComEd responds that FERC itself - in an order last year pushing utilities to
combine their transmission assets into large, regional networks - said
utilities could consider changing the accounting method.

""ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of (parent
company) Exelon Corp. to receive compensation in accordance with what is
permissible by law,"" says Steven T. Naumann, ComEd vice-president in charge
of transmission services. ""The commission will determine if this is what
they meant (in their order) or if it is not what they meant.""

Meanwhile, the city of Chicago, frustrated by ComEd's resistance to sharing
detailed financial data, is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an
outside audit of ComEd's books for 2000. The state attorney general's office
and the Cook County state's attorney's office are joining the city in the
petition, which could be filed as early as Monday, sources say.

The audit, which ComEd opposes, would be aimed at separating ordinary
maintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took
in 1999 and 2000 to beef up its distribution system, after acknowledging it
had neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades.

The behind-the-scenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government
officials are taking the regulatory proceedings. While the new rates affect
only those customers in the competitive market, they'll be the benchmark
used for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in
2005, when the utility's ""bundled"" rates are no longer frozen.

Setting the rules

""The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future
are getting set now,"" says William Abolt, commissioner of the city's
Department of Environment. ""Basically, the next 36 months are going to set
an awful lot of the fees for the future.""

Mr. Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure
ComEd into opening its books, but says it wouldn't be necessary if the
company agreed to do so voluntarily.

A ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a
blanket confidentiality agreement - which intervenors in the case, including
the city, aren't likely to sign.

Ms. Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs
associated with its $1.5-billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate
base. But she allows that most of those are minimal tree-trimming expenses.
Large amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers, as well as contractor
expenses, are included in the rates.

""There's no free lunch here,"" she says.

Says Mr. Abolt: ""Now, it's time to sort that all out. So, let's sort it
out.""

Speaking of Canadian eligible contract participants...I was told from an 
originator in Canada that per someone in Enron Canada's legal department, 
Canadian contract participants are not held to the same standards as US (i.e. 
they are not required to have minimum assets &/or equity etc.).  Is this 
true???  Please advise and forward to me the eligible contract participant 
information we discussed at the happy-hour last wednesday.

Thanks for the e-mail.  I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this ""loss"" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are ""positions"" that should be ""owned"" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?

With respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.  I think he is doing a great job and showing a great deal of integrity in trying to get the best deal for Enron.  Let me know if you disagree.

Mark/ Pat,

Please see the attached file.

It includes a screen print of the xml price curve and the deployment message.

In my conversation with Pat Moast this weekend, I am concerned that we are getting deployed when we should not be.
Today, (i.e. - 9/1/ 2001) the market clearing prices have been approximately $14 (1300HE) to $24 (1200HE) and we have been 
getting deployed.  According to Allgowed at the Real-Time Desk at Ercot, we are getting the MCP when we are deployed.
This brings up two questions.

First, should we be getting deployed based on our Price Curve (see attachment for an example)?

Secondly, are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve?

Please contact us asap to rectify the problem.

Sincerely,
Joe Capassso

897,"This is a very good synopsis of the gas crimes trials in California.  Please 
note comments of Assembly Republican John Campbell---perhaps the sole bright 
spot in the California Legislature...

Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the 
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the 
state,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leaned 
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility 
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natural 
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which it 
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CPUC 
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California border 
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against El 
Paso is The Brattle
Group,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman 
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle 
Group,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not 
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during 
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in 
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a report 
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence 
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Paso 
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens 
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the 
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee, 
said he
""didn,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle 
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I,m not sure that the California 
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell 
said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that,s the 
appropriate place.""

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to 
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It,s being pushed 
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by 
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California 
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: ""There,s a concerted effort, not just on 
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the 
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we,re having in this state and I think you,re seeing some 
of that with the
public utilities commission.""

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas 
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies seem 
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily 
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market 
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out 
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three 
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC,s call for market information, saying the 
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery 
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting 
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their 
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a 
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In 
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC,s recent ruling on the 
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a 
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to drive 
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place 
this summer. (RP00-
241, et al.) NH

		 Subject: Re: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side 
of the Story

Here is the Q&A I will give to Ken on this topic, and I invite any 
improvements:

Question: ""What is your opinion about the study of the Brattle Group (Dr. 
Paul Carpenter) that market power exercised by El Paso and Dynegy exacerbated 
the natural gas price spike at the California border that contributed to the 
electricity price spike.""

Answer:  ""I always discount conspiracy theories when prices rise or fall and 
believe fundamental forces of supply and demand explain prices in this 
instance.  I will say, however, that the transmission grid must be more open 
and transparent to improve everyone's confidence in the economics behind 
price formation.  Long term contracting in the wholesale commodity market 
should also reduce speculation about price manipulation.""

		 Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

The race is on for new coal-fired generation

The race is on! Power plant developers have responded aggressively to the
power crisis in the West and the potential for power shortages in the
Midwest and Northeast, according to a report, New Coal-Fired Generation: The
Race Is On, by Boulder, Colo.-based RDI Consulting.

Using data compiled by RDI, a data division of Platts, the report estimates
the U.S. will require 296,000 MW of capacity additions by 2015 to meet
growing demand and to replace older units likely to retire. This compares
with roughly 780,000 MW of installed capacity in the U.S. today. 

RDI also projects that almost 60% of the required capacity will be built by
the end of 2006 and, despite extreme volatility in natural gas prices, the
majority of this new capacity will be gas-fired-equaling nearly 170,000 MW.
Because of that fact, for developers looking to build coal-fired plants, the
race has turned into a marathon. 

The advantage of proposed coal-fired generation is the potential for low
dispatch costs. Hypothetical plants modeled by RDI in all areas of the
country show new coal-fired generation can dispatch well ahead of gas-fired
plants and somewhat ahead of most existing coal-fired plants. 

Disadvantages of new coal-fired generation are higher initial capital costs
and greater risk, which means that new coal-fired plants are susceptible to
depressed market prices that could result from overbuilding new capacity.
Developers will have two choices in the near term if coal plants are to
succeed: wait out the surge of capacity development and be prepared to enter
the market later in the decade when the excess capacity is absorbed; or
secure long term power sales agreements and capacity contracts that will
provide enough revenue to cover the high development costs of a new coal
plant. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

OPEC's Khelil requests meeting with Russia's Putin
OPEC President Chakib Khelil said Tuesday he had requested a meeting with
Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We have asked as the OPEC presidency for
a meeting with the Russian President, Mr Putin, we have not yet had a
response,"" Khelil told reporters in Algiers. OPEC is currently lobbying
Russia to make a more significant contribution to a planned OPEC/non-OPEC
round of output cuts than the 50,000 barrels per day pledged by Moscow late
last week. OPEC agreed at its Nov. 14 meeting to reduce crude output by 1.5
million barrels per day, but only if non-OPEC producers contribute a further
500,000 barrels per day reduction. Mexico has said it is willing to cut by
100,000 barrels per day, while Norway said last week it would cut by
100,000-200,000 barrels per day, as long as other producers honor their cut
pledges.

Nordic to build power plant, ethanol facility in Ohio
Nordic Energy plans to develop the first new coal-fired baseload project in
Ohio in more than a decade, an 850-MW merchant plant in the northeast part
of the state, the company said Tuesday. The coal plant, which would utilize
integrated gasification combined cycle technology, would be a cogeneration
facility that also would produce steam to run an ethanol production plant
that affiliated Nordic Biofuels intends to build nearby. Nordic Energy will
initiate an anticipated 18-month permitting process for the coal plant early
next year. Commercial operation is expected in June 2006. The coal plant is
expected to cost about $1 billion, and the ethanol facility about $150
million. ""We decided this is the time to build our own plant and move
forward,"" said Joni Fixel, Nordic Energy director of power supply.

"
905,"1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

Thanks,
Gloria

I was told Bradford would, ""release the $1 million tomorrow.""  I don't know what form.  I will find out.  

Also, regarding the usage - I do not know the answer.  Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account - I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low.  We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data - Jeff probably is using the normalized info.  ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security.  We could potentially use our data (their web data) to dispute their own calculation.

Gloria - can we dispute ConEd's calc based on the data we took from the website?  How tight is the approved deposit provision?

Subject:	RE: Enron's Security Review

Gloria,

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

			ConEd Calculation				Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		1,395						1,395
Peak Month MWh	8,993						5,694
Peak Month $		$539,616					$341,653

Electric 45 Day $	$809,424					$512,479
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Subject:	Reliance's Appeal

On Thursday November 9, Judge Richard Aikens of the High Court in London heard oral arguments from the parties' counsel as to whether he should grant Reliance's application to appeal certain points decided by the arbitrators in the partial awards rendered in the case of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. vs. Reliance and ONGC.

On Friday November 10, the judge issued a letter denying Reliance's application, with a statement to the effect that he would issue a formal order with reasons at a later date.

The judge has now given Reliance (and ONGC) a deadline of November 19 to submit to him (if they so choose) a justification as to whether he should allow them to appeal his decision to the English Court of Appeal.

By copy of this note I request Mike Smalling to forward to Larry, Rick, and Radha a copy of the judge's letter of November 10.

915,"Sean just looked these confirms over, and skimmed our contract with Aquila, 
and he said the language is fine as it is. I guess Unrestricted Mid-C is just 
a reiteration of Mid-C. If this causes a problem with your confirm process, 
though, I would have Bloomberg change it. It doesn't seem like we should have 
to go to the trouble of adding another, redundant delivery point name in our 
system just because that's what they call it. I know that sounds mean - but 
I'm so slammed today I can't help it!

Yes this is the first time I've seen unrestricted Mid-C on any of their

know should be Mid-C excluding the into part.  Anyway, I will wait to clear 
this two deals.  Keep me informed.
Below is the two confirms they sent me.

595511 - buy Idaho, May, Mid-C, 330

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Also, Bloomberg sent over some confirmations for deal 595472 and 595473 and 
the location is for unrestricted Mid-C.  Should we have this deal in enpower 
as unrestricted Mid-C because if so it's not a selection currently.   Just 
wondering!!

I didn't really think FPL was going to have something, but it doesn't hurt to try.  I am now trying to find someone I can network with or through at Progress Energy, formerly Florida Power.  Don't have a cousin there do ya??  Just kidding...

I sent her an email thanking her and answering her questions. I will follow-up with a phone call later this week when I get back from Fort Lauderdale-have to go there for work. 

On a sidenote-it was good to see her questions.  I have decided to re-format my resume to make the Enron piece more consistent.  Although Enron people appreciate adaptability and changing roles, I understand non-Enron people may interpret that as NOT being able to hold a job.  It gave me some good insight.

Okay-let me know if you have any other thoughts.  I have to join the LONGEST conference call in the world in a couple minutes.  Cheers,

Hey Joe-
I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,

I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I

Has patent law gone too far?

The courts have granted protection to one-click shopping,
but is this way of doing business so obvious and trivial
that lawmakers should intervene?  And what about online
auctions for selling vacant airline seats? Is intellectual
property law able to cope in the era of Amazon.com and
Priceline.com, or has it become patently absurd? Join us

NEW YORK -- APB Online, which operates the crime,

auction its assets on September 1 with a minimum

927,"Probably not my place to comment but I haven't seen anything from Bryan yet.  
We need to find a better way around this no-one is ever going to consent if 
that is required for specific customers.  But on the major point , having 
spoken to Bryan over th elast couple of days, I believe he is not going to 
quote on any entity we have a big relationship with initially.  I have seen 
the first pass at the list but know that Bryan wasn't happy with it as it 
included people like TXU.

On the other point do you actually mean consent or notification - if we send 
them a notice, follow up with  a phone call on the big ones then we can make 
a business decision about how they feel.  Do they actually need to agree on 
paper?

Subject: Re: Consent  

Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after 
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference 
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were 
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was 
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities 
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each 
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or 
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing 
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of 
these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been 
reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by 
no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet 
determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business 
relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require 
significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to 
make important judgment calls.

My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice 
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved 
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on 
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we 
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those 
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them 
as a Reference Entity.

We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the 
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference 
Entities as soon as possible.

Subject: Consent

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference 
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at 
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions 
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference 
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial 
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits 
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we 
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be 
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that 
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small 
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies 
for the miscommunication.

Call me if you want to discuss further.

I received the benefit book and will look through it tonight. Do you know the 
name of the lady I am susposed to be in contact with at Enron relocation 
services? She called me yesterday but I have forgotten her name. I am 
wondering if I need to have my visa done before she will book the movers. In 
regards to my visa, I have gathered pretty much all the info. that Margaret 
needs with the exception of University transcripts. I had to order those and 
probably won't get them untill early next week.

Thank you for all your help!

Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

Gerald,  good to hear from you and very belated congrats on your law
degree/bar exam/ascent to layerhood deal.  That's way cool.  Sounds like you
are really doing well out there.  Tool belts, house restoration, sounds like
fun.  Too bad the Navy won't allow me the time to do it.   Regardless,
they've been moving me around so much lately that it's all pointless.  I got
back from Italy in Feb.  I started school here in Newport, RI.  Next I'l
spend 3 months in Northern VA going to school.  Then, I'll meet my ship in
the Persian Gulf for a fun filled 4 months in the Desert.  I'm getting
pretty down on the Navy and may be considering a job change in the next two
years.  Well, to answer your question, Michele and I have three kids now.
Kelly is four, Carson is three, and Katherine (Kate) is two months (born
4/15/99).  I figure we're done for now but will have to check back when Kate
is too big to cuddle.  Good to hear George and Ernie are still doing well.
Crazy days we had together.  Funny how we all tend to grow up eventually.
My parents are fine.  They are almost finished with the house on the ranch.
When that is done, they plan to move out there permanently.  John is working
semi-part time as a governemnt employee counting fish on alaskan fishing
boats.  Dangerous job/low pay.  But he likes it and he has his summers for
surfing expeditions (i.e.  he is still bumming around).   Mark is the
biggest suprise, he went back to school and got a Masters degree in library
science and information technology.  He did really well and now has a job
with Microsoft working as an archiver (apparently librarians and computer
geeks too now).  Hey good to hear from you.   don't know when/how we can
work in a visit.  Possibly after March next year unless you're out in San
Diego while Im in the Gulf and you can look Michele up.  Keep in touch and
well work something out.  Take care Gerald.  Paul.

folks from our group who have been looking at this. I want to make sure
that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be

   Subject:  ECS Contract Review & New Idea

   Steve -

   I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my
   time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
   engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I
   think
   we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some
   flexibility
   if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for
   the
   hours we use.

   I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
   options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.  To
   the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close
   whatever
   option you choose.

   In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note
   that I
   would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis
   (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
   full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we
   can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

   Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with
   these
   terms.

   generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
   position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an
   analogy
   here that relates to pipelines.

   Pipelines have operational ""events"" that may have  market effects:
       Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
      Planned outages over a certain volume
      Operation flow order/ SOLs
      Key Plants backed in
      Takes over schedule volumes key points
      Linepack levels
      Pressure drops at key points

   Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
   operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would  be
   studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market
   risk
   (read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to execute
   this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk management
   function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management for
   Pipelines.

   These ""events"" would be studied in the follow way -

   1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  ""event"" and gas
   prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
   2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a trading
   strategy around the relationship.
   3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data - determine
   profitability.
   4.  For operational ""events"" that are  applicable, setup a system to
   execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.


   Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be
   developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of
   selling
   the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some
   combination
   of both)

   Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
   workplan for this study.

   Steve -

    I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If
   your
   team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
   start discussing  with them.

   On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
   rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80
   hours *
   rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate
   to
   put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
   engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by
   you
   before Friday.

   Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
   Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the
   other
   officers.

      Subject:  TW Earnings Idea - Twist on ECS Deals

      Hello Steve -

      Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update -
   I
      moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago
   and
      have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
      Optimization
      projects.

      I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture
   has
      a
      strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability
   Centered
      Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology
   for
      making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
      companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
      This
      is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


      1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
      2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
      3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
      RCM
      (say $20MM) as part of our ""guarantee""
      4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
      the
      next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

      I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am
   around
      the
      Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
      discuss
      further.

      Hope all is well.

14370 - 4:11 PM (officialized)
14378 - 4:17 PM (not officialized)

14370 didn't have the positions, therefore, nothing is being picked up in RiskTrac. 14378 had the positions, but it was not saved as officialized, so RiskTrac is not picking it up as well.

We need to have 14378 saved as official so RiskTrac can pick up the positions.
Please call me if you have any questions.

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Barbara Kurtz

Sara is out of the office for the rest of the week, but I understand why you guys have trouble with me specifically being listed.  Instead of my number being put in there, can we just use the general Enron Corp phone number (1-800-973-6766) and have UBS ask to be connected to the Treasurer's office.  There will always be a person there to take the call, and you will always be directed to the right person regardless of what employee reassignments may occur between now and then.

Jim, what do you think of this?  Christine, since Sara is out, would you please include Jim Armogida on the distribution list.  Thanks.

Subject: Equity Forward Contract


Sara,

Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations 
so promptly.    We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page 8 of 
the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented. 
 Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any 
reason (either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail), the 
termination notice would not be effective.

We propose to insert the following language instead:


	""Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable efforts 
to 
     promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice by 
     telephone (telephone number 713-345-7538) to the Affected Party, 
     provided however, that failure to so confirm will not in anyway 
     invalidate the effectiveness of a notice by facsimile 
transmission.""
     
     (insert as the last sentence of the third paragraph under 
""Additional 
     Termination Event"".)

Please let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will produce new 
contracts with the language and send it back to you for another round 
of signatures.

Please call me if you have any questions.  I apologize for any 
inconvenience this may cause.

Regards,
Christine

There is a new ""FIX"" for the Enpower to PX Report.  Due to the latest version 
of the trade app, the templates that we export and upload into CAPS need to 
be modified prior to uploading.  The templates now contain "";;"" when they 
need to have "";0;"".  So the temporary fix is to go into the template and 
manually enter the 0's where they are missing.

The procedure should be as follows:

1.  export th file to A:\\ as usual

2.  save the file to O:\\ Portland\WestDesk\California Scheduling\PX Final 
Schedules\Final Schedules as usual

3.  Open the file from the O:\\ drive and locate all consecutive 
semi-colons.  There should be a zero between them.  The easiest way to do 
this is the replace function.  In the search menu, select ""replace"".  In the 
""find what:"" boxe, place ;; and in the ""replace with:"" box type ;0;   Then 
choose ""Replace all"" two times.  Save the file and you're done.

4.  Upload the file into CAPS as usual.

This should prevent the problems we have been having with the upload and keep 
Brett happy.  Pete Davis is aware of the problem and we shouldn't have to do 
this for long....

Thanks guys.

968,"Our upstream is Dynegy deal # 570332.1 Mid C HLH

Our Downstream is WWP deal # 339963.1

The path:

West Kootenai (G)-BCH(T)JUANITA/BCUS O#M335781A-WKPL-DYPMI-SNPD(T)BPA(T)BCUS/AVA O#96062 HNF-DYPMI-EPMI-WWP  

MONTH LONG TAG 26019

HE 0700-0800 we are warned by SNPD that the transmission MAY BE curtailed to Zero.

When I spoke with Susan at WWP she finds this very suspicious, as it was described to her as a ""West of Hatwai"" problem she is suspicious of this and is investigating.


Please get with DYPMI and get their re-supplied transmission before this schedule flows in the morning.

I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who
would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their
Energy Club. I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one
of his associates.

Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard
"
976,"Regretfully, Teri Whitcomb has decided to leave Enron.  Her last day will be 
on February 8th.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Teri for her 
contributions over the past year - she will definitely be missed!  Please 
join me in wishing Teri well in her new career.


"
977,"Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing 
our relationships or commercial prospects.

Overall, we respect the effort, but California failed to get the ball over 
the goal line:

On Siting
Intentionally or not, California has designed power plant siting laws that 
make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state.  
Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental 
quality in California.
That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are 
going outside the state to build power plants. 
Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the 
legislation passed yesterday tinkers.
Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to 
keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price 
spikes.
If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a 
dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will 
continue, or worsen.
California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now.

On the retail price cap
They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat 
them hear)
The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply 
puts off the day of reckoning.
It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your 
door to collect.
Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets 
because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a 
couple of years down the road.
So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same 
amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use 
electricity wisely.
There's a better answer:
Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with 
another retail provider.  
Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision 
makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals 
with companies like Enron.  But for the press reports, they hardly know 
there's a crisis.
"
978,"What up dawg! How are you and Meg doing?
I still have a job. It has been an extremely rocky time. However, I feel optimistic that our trading business will continue in some fashion. I believe that we will be bought out by an investment bank and that we will be able to start trading again. The chances are good that I will have to thin out my group a bit, I am hoping that attrition will take care of some of the members of the group. I think we are going to let traders out of their contract if they want to leave. Hopefully that will cut down on any direct lay-offs I will have to do. It would suck having to lay-off good people. Its worrisome but like I said, I am optimistic. Soccer was going well, but I sprained my knee pretty badly playing indoor last night, so another two-three weeks before I am out there playing again...bollocks! Its ridiculous. How are things with you? I have two tickets to Mark Lanegan on December 19th at Berbatis Pan.  Are you going to be in town at that point? Its gonna be sweet. 
Still enjoying the Audi. My address is 1005 SW Park Ave. #706, Portland OR, 97205. Give me a ring and let me know what the word is. 503-887-3449.

Hi.  This is Richard's, and now Erin's, friend Clint.  I know that she spoke 
with you about me, and I wanted to see if you might be interested in getting 
together sometime.  You probably want to know a little about me.  I work at 
Enron as an electricity trader, and I've lived in Houston for about three 
years.  I've known Richard 9 years from our fraternity days together.  I'm 27 
and I graduated from UT 4 1/2 years ago.  Of course, I would be interested in 
hearing something about you as well. Erin just told me that she had a good

Nick and Mark-

per our call last week, we now have our sources engaged on the following background and questions:

Essentially, E-Power Japan, an Enron subidiary appears to be embroiled in a potentially serious FCPA situation as a result of actions taken by one of its counter-parties, Taisei Engineering.

The former (as of Sept.17th) CEO of E-Power Japan is named Tetsuro Seguchi.  Seguchi formed an ""understanding"" with a Japanese company called Taisei Engineering.  The CEO of Taisei Engineering is named Kyuji Takahashi and the General Manager of Taisei is named Koichi Hosokawa.  These individuals were the primary contacts at Taisei for E-Power Japan and Seguchi.  

The nature of the ""understanding"" between Seguchi and Taisei appears to have been that Taisei would help E-Power get site licenses for constructing generators from local prefecture politicians.  Taisei would then get the operations and maintenance contracts for the E-Power operated generators.  It is not clear that these contracts would automatically go to Taisei, but given the rest of the story and what we know about the Japanese construction industry, these types of anticompetitive practices are hardly unheard of and were probably part of the understanding. 

Our Tokyo office believes that these arrangements were struck by Seguchi without the knowledge of the Enron employees seconded to E-Power Japan. The senior Enron man at E-Power was Kerry Sloan.  Another E-Power local hire, a VP named Kuwubara, may also have been involved.

Enron Japan first became aware of the Taisei problem when the new leadership of E-Power met with a local politician in Aumori Prefecture who had been helping E-Power Japan.  The politician mentioned casually that he ""had not been paid for a while."" This caused Enron Japan concern about FCPA violations.  Enron Japan discovered that E-Power Japan had struck two contracts with Taisei: one a ""plain vanilla"" consulting contract which has now expired and the other a more troubling consulting contract for Taisei to help E-Power Japan get a site location for a generator in Onuta Prefecture.

The political ""patron"" of Taisei Engineering is senior LDP politician Shizuka Kamei--runner-up in the LDP leadership last time around and one of the real insiders in Japan.  Seguchi and Taisei apparently used Kamei to pressure local government officials in Oita Prefecture on the northern island of Kyushu.  A deal of some kind was struck and Enron Japan/E-Power would now like to back away from the deal, both because of FCPA concerns and because the deal is not economically viable.  The northern grid is not an attractive investment for Enron Japan and there are problems bringing the power to the southern island of Honshu.

After all that, here is what we need:

1.	Background on the relationship between Taisei and the LDP, especially Kamei.

2.	Details on the links between Taisei and Japanese organized crime.

3.	Reputational information regarding Tetsuro Seguchi and Kyuji Takahashi, particularly ties to criminal groups or corrupt politicians.

4.	Possible political consequences for Enron Japan and E-Power Japan if we back away from the Oita deal, Kamei, and Taisei.

5.	Possible organized crime/security consequences for Enron Japan and E-Power Japan if we back away from the Oita deal, Kamei, and Taisei.

6.	Whether there are any links between the Taisei relationship and the ""E-Rex"" website articles published by ""Sato"" that criticized Enron Japan and E-Power.  One hypothesis is that the articles are a warning by an organized crime group to Enron.

7.	General reputational information concerning how Enron Japan and E-Power are perceived by the Japanese political and banking/energy industry elite.


We are expecting an initial report this Friday. It would be helpful for our investigators if you could send an electronic file of the Japanese language version of the E-Rex articles you sent to me a couple of weeks ago.

Let me know if the above is correct.

Thanks,

RJ

This is Tim Ray.  Long time no talk to.  I am with New Power now and am in 
need of talking over Socal Gas Accord with you.  We are contemplating 
entering the Calf market.  However, it sounds like there are a myriad of 
changes to be implemented by Socal this year that would effect cost curves 
and marketing.  I need to spend some time talking to you about these and how 
they can effect us.

I am really not familiar with the Accord issues at all so I am in true need 
of your help.

A few notes.

1.	Be cautious about divestiture.  Remember we own pipes and a electric LDC.

2.	Agree with you that we don't want Utility in merchant role - key issue.

3.	POLR issue involves getting pricing right.

Why don't you put together a note to the CAEM that we can send as our thoughts.  Just the Top 5 issues.

Attached are summarized the main recommendations of the distco of the future paper and  their impact.
Most recommendations would have a positive impact on competition. However, some recommendations could be potentially dangerous. Besides, it does not have a clear position regarding unbundling: it opens too many unbundling possibilities and discards the extreme, and more effective (divestiture).
I will work on the default supplier paper today.

986,"Wade -  Anywhere that we have Supplier Consolidated Billing Enron put up some form of credit to cover 45+ days of Utility charges.  So while I am unsure of the form of collateral, if Evan provides a list of where we are doing Supplier Consolidated Billing, we should be able to construct a Collateral Obligation worksheet.  We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).  

It will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.

Subject:	RE: deposits

My reading of a memo that SCE sent is that we have a deposit requirement of ~$23MM and that it needs to increase.  It wasn't clear whether that deposit was satisfied with cash, bond or LC. In all areas where we are billing our clients for power and T&D, we may have the opportunity to go to dual billing and receive deposits back, as well as to stop funding the PG&E escrow account.  I would imagine that the tariff provides for our deposits only to be netted against a deficiency in our T&D payments, where we are probably 100% current.

We need to aggregate where we think we have this opportunity and take action today.

Thanks - Dan

I am copying a lot of people on here to try and get as many sources thinking about this as possible.  Dan indicated to me that SCE appears to have a sizable deposit from us on hand (around $20MM) and is asking for more.  How can we trackdown/schedule out all of our deposits.  I would like to think we have them all in a deposit account on our balance sheet, but that is not likely (although Kim, Cindy and Mary Lynne should scour that).

Does anybody have any ideas?????

Dear Christie:

Thank you for your voice mail. Things  are moving along nicely with the 
competition.   Phase II deadline was today, so we hope to have some 
statistics in the next few weeks.  I have attached the statistics from Phase 
I, for your files.  Listed below are ways that Enron could be involved, let 
me know in which (or all) of these Enron would be interested in participating.

* We want to start listing our sponsors, so it would be really good if we 
could get your logo.

* Also, does Enron wish to be a Judge in Phase III and the Venture Fair 
(VF)?  For Phase III, we would mail each Judge about 3 full blown business 
plans to be ranked. We anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon

*  For the VF, we would need a Judge to be present for the entire day.   The 
VF is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students, venture 
capitalists, business entrepreneurs and faculty.  The VF will be held in 
Philadelphia on April 30th.

* At the VF we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot 
table for exhibits or materials to hand out.  We will need to know if you 
wish to use the exhibit space.

*  We plan on providing our 25 semi-finalist teams with one-on-one 
mentoring.  If Enron is interested, that would be about 1/2 or 1 day 
commitment.

*  There might be an opportunity for a workshop to the University community.  
Would Enron be interested in participating in something like this?

I look forward to working with you to make this year's BPC a success.  Thank 
you.

Sincerely,


Anne Stamer

In a recent Washington Post op-ed piece, Dan Yergin and Larry Makovich 
discuss the continued mess of California's electric power problems. Rather 
than fixing the flaws, the current policies from Sacramento are moving 
California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices 
for consumers and businesses. And the shortage is going to get worse this 
summer.

1001,"Mary,

A list of OBA concerns for possible tariff revisions are as follows:

	1.  A mechanism to assure Operators remain within an acceptable tolerance (5%) on a daily basis, or receive a penalty.

	2.  A mechanism to require specific reconciliation periods ( Quarterly).

	3.  A mechanism to require specific periods to allow a final contract disposition to a ""0""  balance, upon reconciliation.

The above suggestions would reduce the misuse of the OBA contacts.

"
1002,"Budget update/suggestions:
 
Piper, Richter, and Webb met with Whalley this Saturday for a few hours on overall EnronOnline strategy and budget.  We showed him the development completed to date and the general development list going forward.  We also showed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 12 months.  We also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forward.  Finally, we showed him the same suggested EOL budget plan we showed you, including 2001 plan vs. 2001 forecast vs. 2002 plan as well as the allocation methodology.  Greg is generally OK with the total 2002 plan number for EOL ($37.7 million fully loaded with bonus, indirects and depreciation), why we want that money and where it would be spent.  What he did not like was the allocation methodology, which is currently cost based and based on development and products.  He suggested a charge that included a fixed fee plus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transaction charge, etc.  Richter and Webb are researching that and will try to see if it will work.  I think you and I can agree the $37.7 million is good for 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for EA.  The current cost based suggestion for EA for EOL for 2002 is about $22 million.  A question is, will you and Lavo accept any charges for 2002 for EOL based on transactions?  Sheriff also has the entire EOL suggested budget and his part.  We meet EIM and EGM today on their total ENW charges.
 
On Operations, the current suggested 2002 EA charge is $44.7 million, which is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast (Sally and Bob and I can explain that in detail this week).  What I would like to do is agree between you and I that you will accept that as EAs budget number for 2002 plan for Operations.  What we still need to work on is how we would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes transaction counts.
 
On infrastructure, the current suggested EA plan number for 2002 $40.9 million.  This is down from 2001 forecast.  This does not include the $10.5 million of controllable expense you budget directly for EA.  The issue left here is what is EAs headcount, what is the headcount in IT development and what is the server infrastructure charge related to IT development that would effect the EA number.  On the first issue, we have the EA headcount as represented by HR.  The current EA infrastructure charge assumes that complete number.  It is larger than the number you have.  You have requested we deal with some of that additional headcount differently since EA can't bill out those on a fully loaded basis.  We will work with Wes and his team on that today and tomorrow to come up with a plan.
 
On IT Development, the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for EA, fully loaded, is $$44.5 million vs. a 2001 forecast of $34.4 million.  Also, the 2002 suggested capital number for EA is $50.1 million vs. a 2001 forecast capital number of $50 million.  The question is, what did you get for your $84.4 million in 2001 and what would you get for $94.6 million in 2002?  First, Mark and Sally and I met on Sunday and we want the 2002 plan numbers to be down from 2001 forecast.  What we need to do in the next three days is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development projects for 2002 for EA.  Our team is Bob Hall, Mark Pickering (Mark will call on Stock and Perlman and Rao and Hotte as he sees necessary) and Greg Piper with Pickering having the final say for ENW. Can you tell me who you want from your side (Story? Belden?) to work with us three over the next few days until we agree?  We want to work on it around the clock until it is at least approximately right.
 
Your thoughts?

Subject: Forward oil prices  


Vince,

As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received 
from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the 
head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, 
he is writing a study about the hedging 
strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would 
like to get forward oil prices form us.

The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point 
for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be 
ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly 
or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. 

Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities 
in Germany, it would be great if we could help 
him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Jens

Subject: Daten


Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,

bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof.
Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer
darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie
benoetigt wuerden.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil
Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle
angibt:

"" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above,
for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources
made available some proprietary historical forward price curves
from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were
used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine
years""

Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten
verfuegbar hat.

Nun zum idealen Datensatz:

Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer
Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum
Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe
Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit
Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.

Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein
kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.

Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen
koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.

Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse

I participated last weekend in the Leadership Forum for Fall 2001 of the Center for Houston's Future.  I wanted to thank you for recommending me as a member of the Forum.  I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many interesting, talented members of the Houston community.  I know that I will enjoy working with the group during our second session, November 1-3, as well as collaborating on some ""homework"" assignments that we will complete between now and then.   I especially am excited about the possibilities of making an impact on Houston's future through developing both relationships and action steps  through my association with the Center.   Thanks again for making this opportunity available to me.  --Sally Beck

You know, I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right now.   Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing projects I will call them directly.    

Before I can do anything, I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels. I do know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this company.  Until I know what the company number is we won't know which ETS group it was consolidated within.  Probably the Services Group, but maybe Corp.  Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp. accounting can look into the actual intercompany allocations if any.  Tracy, can you do me a favor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and I'll try to give you a call later this week.   (Tracy, I may be able to locate the 2000 and possibly the 2001 allocation sheets but I am  not comfortable that we will still have the budget information for 1998 and 1999.  In addition, the true-ups definately do not go to this level.)

Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited financials for EGP Fuels Company.  Included with these financials are footnote 
	disclosures.  Please provide the following information to be included with these financials.

	1)  Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (I would think that the books of EGP should show the actual charges.  Our reserve records only provide a total distribution allocation.  This will have to come from accounting.)

	2)  EGP Fuels' Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (As stated, this is not prepared at the EGP level.  The best we can do here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this will likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not have available. I'll need to speak with AA&CO directly to determine best course of action.)

	3)  EGP Fuels' Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) for benefit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 1998,
	     1999, and 2000.  (Same as above.)

	Cynthia,

	Please note that Sandy and I did talk but I was left with the expectation that I would still receive some type of response, even if that response was merely that 
	the information is not available.   Also, it was suggested that I try contacting You, Mikie and Sandy for this information but I did not receive a response from 
	any of you without additional proding.  And, those responses left me believing that I would hear more from you, which I did not.  Lastly, I did mention that if
	necessary we could look at using Financial Accounting for this information but this is not desirable since this method will result in fragmented and less 
	accurate information.  Also, Arthur Andersen has indicated that this is not the preferred method of providing this information.  

	Based on the email which follows below I will assume that Financial Accounting is my only recourse and that You will assist in convincing Arthur Andersen
	that this is the only alternative available to meet their timing requirements.

Sandy told me she talked with you last week in the elevator lobby.  Just so you know I am not ignoring you I have literally worked 4 weeks straight without a day off and with an average of 14 hour days!  

I can not do this until my budgets and medical pricing are complete.  If you need it immediately, then you will need to do what Sandy talked with you about last week and that is to get with Financial Accounting.  There is no way I can look at this until later this week.

At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:

?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. ""Professional Services"" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.  

?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.

?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations.

FYI

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Governor Chicken

10/22/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The two politicians who've arguably benefited most from the national focus on war are both Californians -- Congressman Gary Condit and Governor Gray Davis. Too bad Mr. Davis is finding he still can't avoid his own chickens coming home to roost. 
Only now are the folks in Sacramento learning that their Governor's ""solution"" to the energy crisis has been a political sham. A combination of collapsing budget revenues, foolish spending and bad credit ratings threatens to plunge the state into a full-fledged financial crisis.
Governor Davis's chickens left the roost back in May 2000, when California's botched scheme to deregulate electric power encountered a wicked price bubble. Wholesale prices, which had been deregulated, shot up, while retail prices, which were still regulated, didn't budge. This mismatch, along with other factors, generated huge supply disruptions and a first-class energy crisis. 
The obvious response would have been to let retail rates rise with the market price. Mr. Davis said so himself in his now infamous observation that if he raised rates, the problem would be solved in 20 minutes. Mr. Davis preferred to play the blame game, including a lot of whining that he had inherited the situation. 
While the Governor complained, California's two largest utilities were pushed into insolvency and neighboring states endured the double whammy of having their power sucked into California and seeing their electric rates shoot up. Californians suffered through rolling blackouts. 
Finally, this past January -- eight months after the energy crisis began -- the Governor responded: Retail rates were increased twice, and the state started to purchase power directly from suppliers, using money from its general fund. At the same time, the state negotiated contracts with suppliers at prices that are now well above market prices and for terms as long as 20 years. 
And then Mr. Davis got lucky. Although the forecast was for a summer of continued blackouts generated by a strong demand for power, the disaster failed to materialize. Not only was the weather cooler than normal, but higher rates produced immediate conservation; thus demand was moderate and power sufficient. Newsweek went out and hailed the Governor as a political Lazarus. 
But now here come the chickens. It seems that almost one-quarter of California's budget revenues were provided by taxpayers with stock options and capital gains, mostly from Silicon Valley companies. When the dot-com industry started to implode, so did revenue projections -- to $12 billion this year, down from $18 billion last year. And this was before September 11 and the collapse in the Nasdaq market. 
California would probably be able to absorb this revenue hit were it not for the still outstanding bills from the Governor's electric power fiasco. Consider the toll: 
-- Somebody is going to have to pay for the $14 billion that the utilities owe to suppliers for power consumed before the state started buying electricity. 
-- Somebody is going to have to repay the $12.5 billion bond issue that California hopes to float to replenish the money borrowed from its general fund. 
-- Somebody is going to have to pay for those expensive, long-term contracts that the state negotiated. 
-- Somebody is going to have to repay the bridge loan of $4.3 billion that California got from the banks hoping to underwrite the bond offering. (If this loan is not repaid by November 1, its interest rate jumps to 7% from 4%, resulting in an extra $250,000 in interest payments a day.) 
Whether these bills are ultimately assumed by ratepayers or taxpayers, or some combination of the two, the impact on California's economy and its budget will be dreadful. Observers are estimating a budget deficit of almost $10 billion for next year. 
As for Governor Davis, the problems of the ""previous administration"" are now his own. And Californians know it. A recent statewide poll showed that most voters preferred the former mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, the leading Republican challenger to Mr. Davis, by several points. 
The Governor's response to the ever-worsening economic situation has been typical. He complains. He vetoes a few spending bills. He announces a $5 million campaign to persuade Californians to help the local economy by staying in-state for their vacations. We expect to see a lot of chickens on surfboards.

My thoughts:  I suggest that each Nelson file be assigned by the paralegals to an attorney mentor as well as Cheryl and that we ask that Cheryl not send any matters out until reviewed by the particular mentor attorney.  In this way we can assure that items are not being externally distributed without review.  I am trying to get with her on all Canada files and have asked that she always check in with me prior to distribution.  However, I think other ISDA world matters are being distributed without adequate review.

1017,"Hi, Janel,

I thought that I initialed those already.  If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.

In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp.  If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.

Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you.

I'll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group.  She can either assist you or find someone else who can.

Thanks.

Hi Michelle,

I received the two executable copies of the CSA between Enron and KDS Communications.  I'm not sure what the next step is.  Should I overnight these to Ken to sign and then receive them back and sign on this end and he gets one and we get one?  And I'm assuming that no one else in legal has to sign off at this point?

If Dave does not have an interest, Brad Larson could also fill in. Any thoughts? If you have no issues I will proceed. Thanks, Rick
"
1022,"Hopefully, when everything is done, it'll be considered quite a bit better than reasonable.  In addition to the $2.0MM cash we should receive next week, the following are included in the deal:

- at least another $1.5MM cash during January
- no further EPCSC expenditures, except for my staff; i.e., GTB assumes all outstanding purchase commitments
- follow-on profitable work consulting for the replacement contractor and/or GTB (scope & rates still to be negotiated)
- a project profit of close to $4MM, about as much as we would have made if the contract were completed, but with no further project risk

I obviously didn't include these items in the report due to the wide distribution.

Have a great holiday.

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (""MS"").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint ""warrants expeditious action.""

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO ""maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay.""  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could ""choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets.""

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, ""To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.""

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
""threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.""  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  ""Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price.""

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, ""ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs.""  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market (""OOM"") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, ""such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff.""  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, ""and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price.""

ISO is then ""put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets.""

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to ""straddle the fence"" and that, ""Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role.""  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, ""Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move.""  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, ""thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' ""  Hebert states that, ""The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter.""  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, ""including the California markets.""

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

I was intrigued by your interview in the 10/30/00 issue of InternetWeek 
Onlineas we seem to share the desire to transform the system.? Despite Enron,
s better business model, robust software infrastructure is as critical to 
Enron,s success as for any other Fortune 1000 company.? Should you agree with 
our mission to deliver that infrastructure, we would be most honored to have 
you join our Advisory Board (includes stock option compensation).

?

SEADE Software is developing a new category of software we call an 
Application Deployment Engine (ADE).? I stress that this is a new category of 
software.? The ADE shares some of the features of several existing 
categories), but no existing product, or combination of products, has 
thepotential of having such a profound, disruptive affect on the process of 
developing complex, enterprise-scale eBusiness software.? The ADE enables 
rapid deployment of feature-rich, secure, scaleable, open-platform, 
best-of-breed eBusiness software in &Internet Time8.? In addition, it 
provides for better and more cost effective life cycle management and 
integration of that software.? Note that the SEADE team has previously built 
the ADE three times as the framework for specific vertical applications.? 

?

While this is a new category of commercial software, it,s not a particularly 
new idea.? What we are doing has in fact always been the way the academic 
world has said complex software systems should be written.? The evolution 
from structured languages, to object orientation has been a continual effort 
to find a means to leverage the effort and resources used to deploy past 
applications for the deployment of the next application.? Most enterprise 
software shares between 60-90% of its core foundation and features with all 
other software.? We call these common horizontal components the &Common 
Horizontal Framework8,of a custom application.? The vertical components are 
the parts that make the software valuable enough to risk the resources to 
develop and deploy mission critical applications. 

?

SEADE Software,s core competency is the delivery of the horizontal components 
that make up the majority of all business applications.? We deliver this in a 
highly customizable, component-based, platform-independent, fully 
internationalized, pre-fabricated software application we call an ADE.? The 
ADE enables fast-tracked development of new integrated eBusiness applications 
and provides a common reference for legacy Enterprise application integration 
(many-to-many EAI).? We empower the Fortune 1000 to maximize their core 
competency by leveraging ours.

?

I,ve attached for your review our Executive Summary, Business Case Slideshow 
pitch, and Advisory Board bios.? Please let me know if you find our offer of 
interest.? Thank you for your consideration.

Please read this notice (copied below and also attached); I will be contacting you next week for your thoughts on what Enron's position should be.

The very good news is the FERC is not asking the cap to be lowered; they are only asking to make it easier to raise it.

Regardless of our position, please be aware that this outcome of this case will likely be an increase in the probability that the cap could be raised above $91.87/MWh.

The earliest possible effective date of any change in methodology would probably be late November.

NOTICE OF TECHNICAL CONFERENCE CONCERNING
WEST-WIDE PRICE MITIGATION FOR THE WINTER SEASON 
AND PROCEDURES FOR SEEKING PARTICIPATION 

	(October 12, 2001)

	
Take notice that the Commission is convening a technical conference to be held on Monday, October 29, 2001, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426.  The Technical Conference will commence at 1:00 p.m. and will be open to all interested persons.   On June 19, 2001, the Commission prescribed price mitigation for California spot markets and markets throughout the West.   In that order, the Commission also invited interested parties to file with the Commission comments and proposals for the purpose of revisiting the mitigation methodology for future periods, if necessary.  This technical conference will address possible modifications to the current West-wide price mitigation methodology for the winter season.

As a starting point for discussions at the conference, and based on the comments that were filed, possible modifications to the current price mitigation methodology include the following:  (1) eliminate the 10 percent adder for sales into California; and (2) require the California Independent System Operator to not only recalculate the price for spot market transactions when there is a Stage 1 reserve deficiency, but also recalculate the price when the average of the three gas indices increase by 10 percent above the level last used for calculating the mitigated price (i.e., 66 cents based on the current average of $6.64/MMBtu).

 
Persons wishing to speak at the conference must submit a request to make a statement in the above-captioned dockets.  The request should be submitted by e-mail to David Boergers at david.boergers@ferc.fed.us (include Docket No. EL01-68-000 in the subject heading of the e-mail), and should be followed up, at the same time, with a letter to the Secretary of the Commission.  The request should clearly specify the name of the person desiring to speak, his or her title and affiliation, and the party or parties the speaker represents.  There will be limited opportunity to participate via teleconferencing. Persons wanting to participate in this manner should specify their interest in their request to speak.  In addition, the request should include a telephone number for notifying the speaker.  The request should also include a brief summary of the issue or issues the speaker wishes to address, not to exceed one page.  All e-mail requests must be submitted on or before Wednesday, October 17, 2001.  

The number of persons desiring to speak at the conference may exceed the time available.  Thus, interested persons are encouraged to join with other persons with 
similar interests.  Based on the requests to participate, panels of speakers will be specified.  The Secretary will issue a notice listing the speakers and panels for the conference.

In addition, all interested persons are invited to submit written comments on matters addressed at the conference.  These comments should be submitted on or before November 9, 2001, in the above-captioned proceedings.  All comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for inspection in the Commission's Public Reference Room at 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, during regular business hours.

1054,"Enron Global Markets ended the year with a great deal of momentum and with 
very high expectations for 2001.  In order to better focus and expand the 
various businesses within Global Markets, we are pleased to announce the 
following organizational changes.

Crude and Products
This group is being re-organized into product lines in order to better focus 
and maximize coverage and increase our market-making abilities.  The 
following individuals leading these groups report directly to John Nowlan.

Global Crude Oil
Don Schroeder and Bill White will manage our global crude oil books.  Don,s 
emphasis will be on the development and expansion of our physical crude 
positions both domestically and abroad.  Bill will manage the various 
financial crude positions globally and will focus on developing these books.

Distillate
Chris Mahoney will have responsibility of all distillate positions.  Chris 
will focus on developing our global distillate strategy, building the 
business both physically and financially.

Global Fuel Oil
Niamh Clarke will expand her role managing our global fuel oil and resid 
positions.  Emphasis will be placed on re-establishing Enron in the financial 
fuel market in the US and developing a physical fuel strategy.

Global Gasoline and Components
Jim Goughary will assume responsibility for our global gasoline and 
components business.  Following up on our expansion into the European market 
in 2000, we look forward to Jim expanding our presence in the US as well as 
Asian Markets.

Global LPG
Erik Hansen and Adam Gross will be responsible for the development and 
execution of our global LPG trading and strategy.  Under their guidance we 
look to expand our presence into the Asian Pacific markets, as well as 
continuing to grow our US and European operations.

Petrochemical and Plastics
Stuart Bland and Douglas Friedman will be responsible for the continued 
development and growth of our petrochemical and plastics business.  They will 
work to further expand both our physical and financial presence in these 
markets.

Fuel Management
Doug Leach will continue in his role developing our fuel management business 
as well as other long-term structural transactions. 

Global Origination
Randy Maffett has joined the group to lead, develop and grow all global 
origination activities for the group.  Randy,s most recent assignment was in 
restructuring several equity investments for ENA.  

Enron Freight
This new group under the leadership of Dan Reck is developing a business in 
the inter-modal transportation area in the United States.  Shawn Cumberland 
has joined this group to lead and expand the origination opportunities in 
this business.  Shawn,s most recent assignment was as COO of the CALME region.

Global Risk Management
Jere Overdyke has elected to leave Enron after almost 10 years of service.  
Per Sekse will take over the leadership of this very exciting and growing 
business.  Per is located in Enron,s New York office but will be spending a 
significant amount of his time in Houston.

We look forward to this year and feel the above changes will provide the 
focus and momentum we need to deliver a record performance in 2001.

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignments.

all employees.  

Password Policy

Passwords(
1. must be at least of eight characters in length. 
2. must not contain names, userids, common English dictionary words, and

Choosing a good password comes down to two things.  First, avoid common 
everyday words a potential hacker,s software will be looking for.  Second, 
keep your password  simple enough that you can remember it without having to

Therefore, it has been reclassified as Tropical Storm Olga. There is evidence that an eye is developing, and we think that Olga will be upgraded to a hurricane in the next 12-18 hours.   The good news is that Olga is forecast to remain well out to sea. The forecast takes Olga on a general W-WNW track through 72 hours at a very slow speed. By late this week, Olga should begin heading northward over cooler waters where it will begin to gradually weaken.   Olga will be no threat to any land areas with the possible exception of Bermuda.   The next commentary will be issued near 3pm CST this afternoon.   Chris hebert

I ended up making my reservation yesterday for 11:00 am tomorrow, I might be able to switch it to 10:00 though b/c they still had it open yesterday.  However, the 11:00 may work out perfectly.    That way when my treatment's done at 12:30 we could just start our day from there - lunch, shopping, etc.  What do you think?  I'm sure I can find some way to occupy myself for a couple of hours on Sat...no worries.

any chance you could get into the spa around 10:00 on saturday?  i'm sure that's a popular time, just wanted to see if that was a slot they'd had available....my study group wants to meet at 10 on saturday, and i'm planning to go for just 2 hours, so it would work great if you could do the spa thing then.  if not, then the beach is right across the street from the library where we'll be meeting so i could always join you there after my study session.....it's sprinkling right now but is supposed to clear up tomorrow and be sunny this weekend ( i hope!!). 

i cannot wait to have a weekend to relax- it has been so crazy here! 

i'll see you tonight!!worst case scenario (contingent upon weather and traffic) i'll pick you up at continental curbside baggage claim.....travel safely!

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Beth Quigley

I am a private citizen with no direct financial interest in the energy
situation in California. However, I possess what is probably an average
sense of decency regarding public behavior and was outraged to read the
public comments of Californian Attorney General, Bill Lockyer, in the Wall
Street Journal regarding your CEO. I am not hopeful that much will come of
my complaint to the State Bar of California regarding Mr. Lockyer's behavior
but feel better for asking the Bar to examine Mr. Lockyer's shameful
behavior.

1074,"Justin and Edmund:

I understand that the two of you are the key legal contacts in London on 
EnronOnline, and I thought that I should contact you regarding 
Clickpaper.com, Enron Net Works' new e-commerce initiative.

Enron is planning to launch next week (with a formal launch in connection 
with Enron Corp.'s analyst meeting on July 25) of a website for Enron's 
trading of pulp and paper products.  The business model is similar to that of 
EnronOnline, but since this website will have a more targeted audience, we 
can expect a broader product offering and greater volumes than is currently 
traded on EnronOnline.  It is anticipated that the site will ultimately have 
global counterparties and will trade physical products at several ""hubs"" 
around the world, although operations will initially be more or less limited 
to the U.S. and Canada.

I understand that the London office has done substantially all of the legal 
work associated with enabling global counterparties to trade on EnronOnline 
(such as adopting appropriate password applications and electronic trading 
agreements and addressing legal issues associated with electronic trading of 
financial and physical products).  While much of that work will be 
transferable to Clickpaper, there may be some unique issues.

I'm not sure if anyone has discussed how to handle the legal work for 
Clickpaper as it expands into European markets, but I thought that I should 
raise the issue.  I don't expect a huge volume of work immediately -- it will 
probably trickle in as the traders expand their operations -- but at some 
point it could become a substantial effort.

I would appreciate any thoughts that you have.

Subject: West LB affiliate registration in Texas for the LM6000 turbine deal

I have spoken to Matt Gockerman in Tax who's comfortable with West LB 
creating a presence in Texas through a partnership owned by Delaware LLCs in 
order to register with the Comptroller prior to receipt of the LM6000 
turbines (which is estimated to be 6/20). Matt will provide the necessary 
forms to West LB/Winston and will coordinate with them for timely completion. 

West LB will be putting together a closing check list for this to occur, 
including registration forms, ADA assignment agreement and West LB guaranty, 
etc. Kay and Rob, can I ask you to coordinate what if anything needs to be on 
the list from the commercial side beside the assignment under LM6000 turbine 
purchase agreement.  We'll schedule a call in the next few days to coordinate 
with Winston and West LB on this matter.

Thanks,
Matt

Dear Gerald,

I'm surprised you were moving at all the day after the party! I'm not to
sure on the Tequila/Cranberry mix either but as you say - it's always good
to try new things, I just wouldn't advise trying it again that's all!  I had
a good time too, wasn't that drunk either by the end which is a bit of an
unusual occurrence for me.
This past weekend we had a party put on by the law school so we went to that
Friday night and then shopped til we dropped on Saturday - my flat mate has
been having a bit of a hard time so I gave her a day of Sophie Therapy - she
seems a lot more relaxed now - I hope it will last. Saturday I also caught a
cold so I've been feeling pretty rough the last couple of days although I
think it's gradually going now so fingers-crossed I'll be okay to party hard
this weekend  - although I've no plans as yet.
Oh, I haven't heard of that band by the way but it sounds good anyway, and
yes I do like yorkshire puddings - how can anyone not - obviously you should
have the full compliment of beef, roast potatoes and vegetables and gravy
(although I'll gladly do without the beef) but they're gorgeous - don't you
think? Hmm.
Anyway, better get on with some work,
have a good week, whatever you're doing, any interesting deals?
Sophie.

On Friday's call, one thing in particular troubled me that I wanted to mention privately.  You said, I believe, that senior management doesn't see a role for government affairs in the SEC/partnership issue.  I think that's a fundamental error.

I know I haven't been here as long as others, but after five months one things is crystal clear to me: There are people out there who really hate us, commercial competitors, politicians, interest group types, etc.  I fully anticipate they will use recent events as a way to try and do us further harm in the political, regulatory, public perception arenas.  

I would hate for our senior management to think that this will play out in a nice orderly legal proceeding where everything is dealt with in terms of facts and reason and law.  I believe this episode will play out more along the lines of CA, though on a smaller scale, where demagogues use this for their own advantages.  

I believe gov't affairs needs to play an important role sooner rather than later.

1086,"A quick update from the litigation front.

I met with Scott Josey this afternoon.  As I understand it, we have visited 
the data room and are preparing to make a bid next Friday for the gathering 
system.  I told Scott that common-sense dictates that  if we file a lawsuit 
now Tom Brown will probably tell us to take a hike and we will have no chance 
whatsoever of winning the bid process.

That being said, we have decided to put a hold on any litigation until after 
the bid process is complete.  Hopefully, we win the bid and the problems go 
away.  If we do not win the bid process, we will plan to initiate 
negotiations immediately with the new purchaser and, if necessary, file a 
lawsuit to preserve our legal rights.

Ken Krisa is in the process of putting together damage calculations.  His 
preliminary numbers indicate that, to date, we have been hurt to the tune of 
$100,000.  While this is not much, Krisa is concerned that damages could 
increase dramatically over the length of this contract.  I also just learned 
from Gerald that Tom Brown has - at least for this month - allowed us to 
nominate gas to Northwest Pipeline.  Very interesting.

I will continue to keep you apprised of all developments.

SCIENTECH IssueAlert, November 13, 2000
The New Power Company: Going Green While Stock Price Drops
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

The New Power Company (TNPC, NYSE: NPW), which bills itself as the first
national residential and small business energy provider, announced that
it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy, Inc. to provide
wind-generated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area. Under the
terms of the agreement, TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community
Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast 
Pennsylvania.
The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of 2001.

ANALYSIS: This is an interesting development, especially considering that
TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant
number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from
PECO Energy. This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers
who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain. On the other hand,
it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company,
founded earlier this year by Enron (along with partners AOL and IBM).

As you may recall, just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached
an agreement with PECO Energy to supply ""competitive default service"" for
approximately 300,000 of PECO's residential electricity customers who have
not selected a competitive energy service provider. Green Mountain formally
challenged this agreement, arguing that the PECO/TNPC agreement is ""not
in the public interest"" and that Green Mountain should have been awarded
the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question.
Thus, it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of
wind power to its portfolio of services. Up to this point, TNPC has been
working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers,
such as the approximately 285,000 natural gas and 20,000 electricity customers
it purchased from Columbia Energy Group. The acquisition of the customers
in PECO's territory was a major coup for TNPC, which is still in start-up
mode. Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from
PECO, the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further
objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity
as a provider of renewable energy.

Community Energy, the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power
that it will market, began making wind power available to businesses in
Pennsylvania last year. TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy
in fixed kilowatt-hours, allowing for more customized service and tailored
use of power. Interestingly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed
a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about
37,500 MW of green power to aggregated state agencies. This indicates that
desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania, and any energy
provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green
power in its portfolio. Thus, while renewable energy was not a fundamental
component of TNPC's original business plan, the company appears to be moving
in this direction (at least in states where it is strategic to do so).

However, this announcement comes on the heels of TNPC's announcement of
its third-quarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price. TNPC's
revenues for 3Q 2000 were $18.2 million, derived from the sale and delivery
of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states 
(Pennsylvania
and New Jersey). Gross profit was $1.3 million, or 7.2 percent of revenues.
Yet, the loss on earnings before income tax (EBIT) was $68.3 million. The
net loss for the quarter was $69.9 million, or $2.96 per basic share. TNPC
reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history.
Therefore, the company contends that its year-over-year comparisons are
not meaningful or indicative of future performance. The company's goal
for 4Q 2000 is to achieve revenues of approximately $60 to $63 million,
with an estimated year-end customer count of 340,000.

Eugene Lockhart, TNPC's CEO, said he was pleased with the 3Q performance.
Lockhart contends that TNPC ""achieved both our overall financial performance
targets and business objectives,"" and referenced the fact that the company
is still building its ""systems and architecture"" so that it can continue
to penetrate additional competitive markets. In addition, TNPC has raised
approximately $546 million in funding which the company is using primarily
to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation.

However, despite its positive outlook, after TNPC made its earnings 
announcement
its shares took a nosedive, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy
provider's ability to meet its objectives. The shares closed last Friday
at $9, which is a dramatic drop from the average price of $25 before the
3Q earnings announcement. TNPC issued its IPO on Oct. 5, 2000, at a price
of $21 per share, which at the time seemed quite high for a start-up energy
company with a limited track record. A day after its opening, the stock
closed at $27 per share. The stock was received so favorably for two reasons,
in my estimation. First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments.
In two separate, private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital
Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214
million in start-up capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron
is the majority owner of TNPC, with 57-percent control. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and
small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC. Together
with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has come out of the gate
running with a significant beginning customer base of over 325,000 customers.

Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock, and
the company is at a crossroads. In order to keep its momentum on track,
TNPC needs to do two things. First, it needs to acquire additional customers
to expand its base. Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best 
opportunity
to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace
in those states. Second, as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov. 6, 2000,
energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative
fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors.
Consequently, it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that
it will be a provider of wind power. This could potentially send the stock
price on a upward climb again, despite the fact that financial success
of the company is still unproven.

Regarding the customer base expansion, Ohio looks like the next state that
TNPC will target. Just last week, the company filed an application with
the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state.
Yet, it's clear that TNPC is still fine-tuning its marketing approach.
In Ohio, it is offering customers competitive energy prices, flexible payment
and pricing choices, and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive,
but there is no mention in TNPC's application that it will provide renewable
energy in Ohio.

Moreover, several questions remain. Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role
for itself as a renewable energy provider, or it just providing wind power
in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state? Will the addition
of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC? Will TNPC 
demonstrate
revenues of $63 million in 4Q 2000? And where will the company's next 
acquisition
of customers take place? All of these questions directly impact the future
success of TNPC.

1089,"We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These changes 
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful 
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe.  
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built 
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting 
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton,s departure, the ability to 
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units 
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromising 
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or 
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yielding 
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to 
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate 
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale 
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and 
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to 
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of 
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension of 
Enron,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and 
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European 
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets 
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron,s Net Works business unit 
as well as a new unit ) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron,s merchant 
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this 
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assume 
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley, 
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office 
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our 
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership 
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President 
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibility 
for managing all of Enron,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of North 
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO 
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will 
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for the 
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our 
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region 
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office of 
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for 
Enron,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this business 
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
 
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined 
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and will 
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term 
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to 
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EES 
to lead EES, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In order 
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to 
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for 
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron South 
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to 
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the 
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations 
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale 
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg,s previous responsibilities as President and 
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg.  

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for 
operating Enron,s South and Central America asset base, all trading, 
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will report 
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility 
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South 
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief 
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron 
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron,s businesses in Australia 
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John 
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and 
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have 
responsibility for Enron,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the 
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and 
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to 
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the 
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance, 
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McMahon, 
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed by, 
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in 
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more 
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across 
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These 
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations ) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Office 
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works, 
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice 
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinated 
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the 
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these 
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will 
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible 
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal ) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs ) This function will remain organized on a 
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in 
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all 
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also continue 
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions 
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chief 
of Staff.
Public Relations ) This function is also organized primarily on a regional 
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity, 
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue 
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Ambler 
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as 
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.  
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship 
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting ) Wes Colwell will expand his role to cover 
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale 
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization 
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investments 
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to 
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Cliff 
Baxter,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of Enron 
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources, 
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In 
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and 
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and 
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron,s 
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our 
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to 
be the communication of relevant information across Enron,s businesses and 
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be 
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the 
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses.  
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee ) the Enron Corporate Policy Committee.  
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel 
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy 
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to 
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and 
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

1091,"I've reviewed the attachment that I previously forwarded to you with Gary 
Fergus.  Basically, the CalPX ""converted"" any unsigned performance bond into 
""additional collateral requirements"" for both CORE and CTS markets [this 
relates to the letters received by EPMI, EES, and PGE today regarding 
unsigned indemnity agreements; please let me know if you did need a copy of 
them].

Questions are (1) do they have a right to do this although it is not under 
the tariff and (2) I thought Enron was already obligated under the CTS bond 
requirements via the ""rider"" to Enron's existing surety bond w/AIG that was 
handled in 1999 supporting CTS activity?  Richard, didn't they verbally 
communicate that to you when you visited them last week as well?

With respect to the letters received by all 3 Enron entities:
EPMI received (2) letters from the CalPX - one for the CORE and one for the 
CTS market.  However, EPMI did not receive a margin call today (as indicated 
in the letter that the PX would do) for any deficit...based on the attachment 
below, EPMI has a deficit in the CORE market of ($32.2MM).
EES received (1) letter from the CalPX pertaining to the CORE market.  EES 
also received a VERBAL margin call today i/a/o $18MM.  EES has current 
collateral in the form of a $2MM letter of credit (which was originally 
posted to the CalPX in order to establish EES as a market participant so that 
EES could use the PX for market viewing purposes).  Since EES has been an 
inactive PX participant and I did not see how EES could get a margin call 
based on the definition of charge-backs, I called Chris Anderson at the PX to 
get an explanation.  Chris Anderson indicated that yes, although EES has 
never been active, Lynn Miller (CalPX CFO) is taking all steps to send out 
letters to any and all participants who have not signed the indemnity 
agreement and following through with any necessary margin calls.  The $18MM 
margin call is per Chris Anderson ""a formality measure"" although he did not 
figure that EES would post $18MM collateral.  He also stated that he did not 
see EES getting an invoice in the future or being paid anything in the future 
given its inactive status.  I expressed my concern that the PX would 
potential draw down on the existing $2MM letter of credit if EES did not post 
the $18MM margin.  He said that the PX would only draw down on the L/C if 
""EES did not pay an invoice from the CalPX.""  So, unless something new arises 
out of the tariff [such as a revision in the definition of charge-backs], I 
do not foresee EES receiving an invoice in the future from the CalPX but you 
never know.  IT IS STILL A MARGIN CALL for $18MM.
PGE also received (1) letter from the CalPX pertaining to the CORE market.  
However, PGE did not receive a margin call today (as indicated in the letter 
that the PX could do).  I spoke with Tyesha Woods, credit mgr at PGE, 
regarding the letter and its current collateral position with the CalPX.  
Tyesha Woods indicated that during her last conversation with the CalPX, 
since PGE was due money for power deliveries, the CalPX should ""net"" any 
required collateral from PGE from its expected receivables.  The PX at that 
time agreed to use the as an offset.

 CFTC Charges Two Tx. Men With Defrauding Former Employer

 WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced Monday it has filed an administrative action against two   Texasmen for defrauding their former employer, Coastal Corporation.   The CFTC says over a five-month period during 1996, Clay Krhovjak, of Bellville, Texas, and Paul Cochran, of Houston, engaged in a fraudulent trading scheme to allocate profitable trades belonging to Coastal to accounts controlled by other unnamed scheme participants. 	
   	
  The two men were assistant vice presidents at Coastal'scommodity futures trading desk in   Houstonand were responsible for placing energy futures orders for Coastal with floor personnel at the New York Mercantile Exchange, the CFTC said.   The CFTC said the men conducted their scheme through Refined Energy, Inc. of Red Bank, New Jersey, which was one of the NYMEX floor operations used by Coastal.   ""This allocation scheme ensured Cochran, Krhovjakand other participants risk-free personal profits,"" according to the CFTC complaint.   The CFTC also alleges the two men defrauded Coastal by trading ahead of the firm's futures trades, in that they used advance knowledge of Coastal trades to obtain profits illegally for themselves and others.   A public hearing will be held at a later date to determine if the allegations are true and if so, what sanctions are appropriate, the CFTC said.   Separately, in September 2001, Krhovjakand Cochran each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Sentencing in that case is expected in early 2002, the CFTC said.   -By Kim Archer, Dow Jones Newswires;   202-479-0853; Kim.Archer@dowjones.com

Subject:	FW: Organizational Change


One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organized in a way that allows all of us to provide quality services to our clients in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is to modify our internal organization to better track the ""functionalized"" organization that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial areas.  Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our resources to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that Colleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediately.  Richard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Colleen's team will have primary responsibility for serving the ""new business generation"" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operations group.  Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sale transactions and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead responsibility on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each of these lawyers will also continue serving the numerous other clients they assisted before this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the rest of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way acquisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Greg Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory activity on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Monday, as Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, and will coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot as he gets up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will continue its role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus/FGT.  Dot's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group, the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexible.  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with projects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the challenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy!  

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in welcoming Bill to the group on Monday!

The only modifications to ECFC's online GTC's are as follows:

lines online GTCs, we've modified this section to reflect the same 
introduction as reflected in ELFI, EGLI, ERAC and EPC.

Damages and Limitation We've added a 2 line bilateral provision regarding 
payment.

Financial Information We've added the two paragraphs re credit provisions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Compliance with U.S. Laws We've added the buyer/seller trade sanctions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

revised sections are shown in italics. (Please note that the second answer
indicates that Phase II is 80 percent complete, but the proposed

Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

EnronOnline and other markets in which Enron participates (not to
mention our li'l chat about English clothes  :-)

Just wanted to send you a note reiterating the offer to answer any
questions you may have regarding EnronOnline or Enron.  Having gone
through the development process of EnronOnline and some of the other
initiatives within Enron,  Louise and/or I should be able to provide you
with insights in case you have questions.

1115,"Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.  In order to 
reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups 
and managers have very low participation rates.

I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% 
participation (ie) the ""unhappy"" folks are more likely to input info than the 
""happy"" folks.

Subject: ""The Pulse"" Employee Survey

""The Pulse"" is the new name for the employee survey -- formerly known as 
Excellence Through Communication.  It is scheduled to rollout on Monday, 
October 16.  In an effort to boost participation, I would like to ask for 
your assistance in spreading the word to your direct reports at your staff 
meeting.  They should, in turn, encourage their direct reports to 
participate.  Last year, ENA's participation rate was approximately 50% and 
our goal for this year is 60%.

The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete and can be 
done electronically.  The topics covered are:

 1) What are the obstacles to performance and effectiveness?
 2) What things hinder job satisfaction and fulfillment?
 3) What more can be done to make Enron the best place to work?

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at ext. 3-9053.  
Thanks.

MEXICAN DEMOCRACY
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.
----------

GREAT BRITAIN
You have two cows.
The government shoots one cow because it has Mad Cow.
The government comes back and shoots the other one because it has foot
and mouth.
----------

EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking
apply.
If there aren't any, they invent some.
They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down
the drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing
cows.
----------

AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.
----------

CAPITALISM
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
You sell them and retire on the income.
----------

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters
of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a
debt/ equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all
four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights
of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island
company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the
rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.  The annual
report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

1124,"Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term 
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The 
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't 
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that 
the File Room doesn't have anything either).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) 
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.
______________________________________________________________________________

I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) 
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.

Barbara and Bill,

Hope your travels have (or will) return you safely.  I prepared the
following based upon our discussion last Sunday involving our collective
review of the contracts.  I provided these to the group today, with the
understanding they were darft due to the fact that neither of you have had
an opportunity to reivew.  The plan is that tomorrow, the Speaker will be
attending a portion of our meeting, and we'll present to him our findings
on the agreements.

Thanks

Per our discussion on Monday, we need to give CES-Retail a bid for the two 
TCO transportation contracts that were dedicated to c&i customers that they 
will no longer need once they sell their c&i business effective 6/1/00.  As 
you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402); 
the other is to BG&E  for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403).  This is the 
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that 
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest 
that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.  I think 
this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it 
up!!).    If there is any problem with this, please let me know.

True Orange Crystal Ball Shows 2001 Season
Will Be Longhorns' Break-Through Year

My crystal ball was a little faulty last year because it didn't show TE Bo
Scaife going down for the season in the first pre-season practice.
Without that important piece of data, I predicted the Longhorns would win at
least 10 regular season games.
They won nine without Scaife and I think they would have won 10 with him
because the Stanford loss came before the great freshmen wide receivers
became the go-to guys on the team.
I'm more confident this year because the Longhorns are deeper and even more
talented than they were last season, so I'm going to go way out on a limb and
predict the 2001 season will be remembered as the one we all will recall as
the Horns' ""break-through"" year.
By that, I mean I think they will break into the top 10 and stay there for
years and years.
Since the Longhorns haven't finished in the top 10 since 1982, that sounds
like a tall order for this team.
This will be coach Mack Brown's fourth team at Texas and it should be his
best one by far.
His fourth recruiting class will enroll in September, and it will be his
third straight great one. that means the first group of great recruits will
be starting their third years. They will be juniors or redshirt sophomores.
The third year normally is one when players who have been able to play at a
high level at times learn how to play at a high level consistently.
This team will have some flaws, but every team has flaws. The great teams
simply have enough great players to win in spite of their flaws.
The Longhorns have offensive weapons that are almost off the chart. With a
healthy Scaife, who is that rarity at TE ) a swift, sure-handed guy who can
turn a six-yard pass into an 80-yard score ) to go along with
sophomores-to-be Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson, who broke every Longhorn
freshman receiving record last year.
When a team has an awesome tight end, and Scaife is one of those, with
sophomore Brock Edwards not too far behind, it creates match-up problems for
any defense.
Linebackers normally cover tight ends, and good tight ends, even one who
aren't really fast, usually win those matchups. Fast tight ends who can catch
in a crowd usually draw coverage from a safety.
But then Williams and Johnson create problems because Williams almost always
draws double coverage and Johnson is a huge threat to go all the way if one
safety is worrying about Scaife and the other one is helping out on Williams.
QB Chris Simms seems to be developing into the great player he was expected
to be after all the recruiting services tabbed him as the No. 1 prospect in
the country when he was a senior in high school.
The obvious solution for a defensive coordinator would be to play five or six
defensive backs most of the time or to go to a zone defense.
But Brown says the Horns will be a better running team than they have been
since Ricky Williams departed, and a more experienced line and a bigger
tailback should make that happen.
Hodges Mitchell was a great little tailback, but this offense is designed
primarily to pass or run between the tackles.
When you want to run between the tackles, it helps to have a big, powerful
tailback.
The tailback this season, whether it is one of the returnees or heralded
recruit Cedric Benson, will be bigger and more powerful than Mitchell.
The line was a good pass-blocking unit last year, and with four of the five
guys back, it should be much better this year.
The only big question about the offense will be one of consistency. When
Simms, who shared time with Major Applewhite last season, was at the helm,
the team often had long, long dry spells.
In the 43-17 victory over Texas A&M, for example, what most people remember
is the Longhorns' four-touchdown explosion in the third quarter.
But I remember being scared silly at the half because the offense had made
only one first down in the entire half and the defense was showing signs of
tiring because of all those 3-and-outs.
And that was not an unusual happening. In the bowl loss to Oregon, Simms took
the Longhorns on long back-to-back scoring drives in the second quarter, but
the Horns generated little offense in the first and third quarters.
I could cite other examples, because there are plenty to cite, but Simms is a
year older and wiser and so are the receivers, who performed better last
season than any of us have a right to expect true freshmen to perform.
A bigger, stronger tailback also will be able to pick up more of those
third-and-short downs than the team did last year.
Defensively, eight starters return from an outstanding unit.
The Longhorns lost two great defensive tackles, but the power teams in the
Southern Division of the Big 12 rely a lot more on the pass than they do on
the run, and the tackles UT will play this year are quicker and might supply
a better pass rush.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also made several position changes in the
spring that are certain to generate a better pass rush.
If you remember the Oregon game, the Ducks used quick, undersized linemen to
harass Simms and it worked remarkably well most of the time.
With former DE Maurice Gordon now a super quick DT, and former OLB O. J.
McClintock now a super quick DE, look for the Longhorns to be a much better
pass rushing team in 2001.
I do worry a lot about the Horns' place-kicking, but the coaches are bringing
in several walk-ons and, hopefully, one of them can kick off into the end
zone and make most of the 40-yard field goals.
Even if the kicking problems aren't solved, this is a team with enough
weapons, offensively and defensively, to be a top 10 team.
No one in the college ranks will be better or deeper at the receiving
positions, particularly when the tight ends are added to the mix, and few
teams will have better defensive secondaries.
The offensive line will be one of the best pass-blocking lines in the Big 12,
and the defensive line, despite having two new tackles, also will be one of
the league's best.
Here's the way I see the Big 12 South race winding up, and, briefly, why I
place each team at its particular spot:
1. Texas - Too many big play guys for the other teams to stop.
2. Oklahoma - Defending national champs could do it again if they can find
another great QB.
3. Texas Tech - Big passing game too tough for everyone in South but Texas
and Oklahoma.
4. Texas A&M - Even R. C. Slocum says the Ags ""will not dazzle anyone with
talent.""
5. Oklahoma State - Team has too many holes and too tough a schedule to do
any better.
6. Baylor - Bears still find Big 12 a tough row to hoe with little offense
and overworked defense.
Nebraska should win the North, mainly because the Huskers host the big game
with Kansas State.
The Southern Division teams have beaten the North three times in the five
championship games and I think Texas or Oklahoma will make it four this year.
The  South is a lot stronger than the folks ) and particularly the pundits )
in the North think, and it's getting stronger every year.

UT Starts Another Great Recruiting Year with First Pledge

The Longhorns have three great recruiting classes in succession, and they
made a good start on a fourth earlier this month when outstanding Brownwood
junior OL Bret Valdez. 6-4, 310, 5.1, confirmed he has committed to the UT
coaches.
Valdez, one of the state's great run blockers, said he went to the UT spring
game March 31 and really liked what he saw.
He said the Texas coaches offered him a scholarship  at the spring game.
""They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year""
he said, adding that he went home and talked to his parents about it and
decided he wanted to be a Longhorn.
He said he came to Austin the weekend after the spring game and  competed in
the Texas Relays, throwing the shot and discus.
"" After I was through competing,"" he said, ""I went over to the coaches'
offices and talked to coach (Mack) Brown and coaches (Tim) Nunez and (Mike)
Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit. I'm really excited about being
a Longhorn.""
He said he also was being recruited by about 20 other schools including
Florida State, Texas A&M, Oklahoma, Alabama and Notre Dame.
""The first time they can come see us is in May and Florida State, A&M, OU,
Notre Dame and Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to come
down and see me then.""
But he said they need to change their travel plans because he is firmly
committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other coaches who contact him
that he is a future Longhorn.
""Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a
great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two,"" he
said. ""I like the way they emphasize academics, too.""
""I think I'll have a good chance to start after a redshirt year,"" he said.
The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next
February, and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other
offensive line prospects I have been talking to, so they must consider Valdez
to be the state's top OL prospect.
Brownwood went 11-2 last year, and Valdez was the team's top blocker. He has
thrown the shot 53 feet and discus 162-7.
On tape, Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start that
allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward.
He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have
seen this year.
One of the best things about him is that he is only 16 and won't turn 17
until June 15, but he already benches 320 and squats 600.
* * * *
The Longhorns need a bumper crop of defensive linemen this year, and they
stand a very good chance to get an early commitment from one of the top ones
around at their early June camp.
He is Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of Scottsdale Chaparral, a top DT who is
the No. 1 recruit in Arizona.
Sendlein is the son of former UT and NFL LB Robin Sendlein, and he is the
brother of UT redshirt freshman LB Austin Sendlein.
I talked to Sendlein Sunday and he told me he is coming to the June 4
Longhorn camp.
I asked him if he is planning on going to any other camps this summer.
""It depends on what happens at the Texas camp,"" he said. ""I might commit. I
really like Texas.""
He said he also is being recruited by Notre Dame, Arizona, UCLA, Arizona
State, USC and ""about 15 other schools.
* * * *
Another top DT prospect who is a strong Texas lean is Kasey Studdard, 6-2,
260, 4.8, of Highlands Ranch, Colo.
He is the son of David Studdard, a former UT offensive line star who started
for the Denver Broncos for about 10 years after his career at Texas.
Studdard told me Sunday he probably isn't going to go to any summer camps,
but he said, ""I really like Texas."" He said other schools recruiting him
include Colorado, Colorado State, Nebraska, Washington, USC and Missouri.
His sister, Katie, recently accepted a basketball scholarship at Northern
Colorado.
* * * *
DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, who has thrown the shot nearly 61 feet, says
he is bigger and also a little bit faster than I have him listed.
""I'm 6-4 1/2, 270 and I run a 4.68 40,"" he said. He's also an honor student
who carries a 3.6 GPA on a 4.0 scale and has already made a qualifying score
on the SAT.
""I want to take it again to try to do better, but I've already made a
qualifying score,"" he said.
When I asked him if he plans to go to any camps this summer, Dibbles said,
""I'm going to the Nike camp at A&M and a Texas camp, probably in late June. I
might go to one more camp, maybe at Oklahoma.""
He said Oklahoma, LSU, TCU and SMU have already offered him a scholarship,
and said other schools recruiting him include UT, Notre Dame, A&M, Purdue,
Florida and Nebraska.
When asked what he is looking for in a school, he said, ""Academics has to be
first. I want to major in something in the engineering or computer range.
""I also want to know about the graduation rate for football players. The
coaches are important, too, and the chance to get playing time.""
He said he went to the Longhorn coaches' offices after competing in the Texas
Relays and met with head coach Mack Brown, DE coach Hardee McCrary and RB
coach Bruce Chambers, who recruits the Lancaster area.
""It was nice in Austin,"" he said. ""I'm pretty interested in Texas.""
He also said he thinks Lancaster has a chance to make a good run in the
playoffs this year. ""We got to the third round last year and lost to Ennis,""
he said. ""Ennis won state and we had a lot of young players, so we think we
have a chance to do better this year.""
* * * *
Some of the top football players in the state are also some of the top track
performers.
UT CB signee Michael Huff  won the District 7-5A sprints in 10.69 and 21.68
and anchored the 400-meter relay to victory in 41.32.
Another Longhorn CB recruit, Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, won the
District 27-5A hurdles in 13.75 and 37.76. He also placed fourth in the
triple jump with a 42-3 leap.
There are always a lot of regional qualifier meets between the district and
regional meets and junior RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney had some great times
at the one in Glen Rose Friday, running a 10.1 100 meters and 20.7 200
meters. UT WR recruit Quan Cosby of Mart was second in both races, running
10.5 and 21.18.
Junior RB/CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland, who is undefeated in the
dashes this year, ran 10.36 and 20.89 and anchored his 400-meter relay team
to a win in 41.07 in a regional qualifer meet in Mansfield. Huff was second
in the 200 in 21.54 and third in the 100 in 10.55.
UT LB recruit Derrick Johnson ran a 10.79 for third place in the 100 in a
regional qualifiers meet in McGregor. He has run a 10.6 this year.

I am in the process of cleaning up the February folder.  When finished you 
will see two DPR's - NG-Price & NG-PR-OPT.  Mike and John have decided to 
split out the old NG-Price book so that swaps/futures go to John and 
options/exchange options go to Mike.  I will call you as soon as I have it 
done.  Tonight is the first night we are using the new book.  I have not 
heard anything back regarding the January variance since I left you the voice 
mail.

Thanks,

Errol

Errol,

I received a book request for the NG Options Book (Code ZH). Will this be a 
new roll in the NG Price book, associated with the PG book code? Also, I 
noticed that the PG book has three DPR's in the February folder. Should I be 
using the 022001NG DPR or the 022001NGmike and 022001NGjohn? What did you and 
Todd decide to do with the January variance from the NGP&L? Too many 
questions!!

Thanks!

1152,"
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Today's focus: 802.11a access points, Part 1

By Neal Weinberg

The Reviewmeister couldn't wait to test the new 802.11a
wireless access points. These babies run at a screaming 54M
bit/sec, compared to only 11M bit/sec for 802.11b products.

We tested four products from three companies: Proxim's Harmony
(targeted at the enterprise), Proxim's Skyline Access Point,
Intel's Pro/Wireless 5000 and SMC's 2755W access point. All are
based on the same wireless chipset/reference model from
Atheros, but unlike cookie-cutter 802.11b products, their
flexibility, management and performance varied.

In our tests, two of the three vendors, Proxim and Intel,
submitted products that performed consistently. The speed demon
(over the widest broadcast range) in the bunch, SMC, had very
fast performance - and occasionally, highly erratic behavior
until we downloaded ""another Version 1.0"" of its firmware.

Compatibility between different access points and the CardBus
adapters supplied was very good. In 802.11a mode, all the
adapters could connect to every access point - even with Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption enabled. In ad hoc mode
(connecting two PCs without an access point), all the adapters
worked well together with the other access points, with some
cards having better speed.

But when we used ""turbo mode"" (a multichannel, nonstandard
mode) between an access point and a competing adapter, we
couldn't achieve a connection between that card and the access
point. For now, turbo mode shoots compatibility dead between
different products, resulting in disappointing performance.

* Proxim

Proxim clocked in the fastest rates, both in compatibility mode
and with its own access point. Running against the Intel access
point, the Proxim card turned in a 22M bit/sec score. Proxim
also turned in the best score with its own access point, with
17.6M bit/sec.

Proxim's Harmony product line uses a central wireless hub
management appliance to control the Harmony access points. The
management appliance then controls the Proxim access points
(802.11a or 802.11b) on a subnet. We found the Web-based access
point controller application to be incredibly thorough and easy
to use with multiple Harmony access point deployments.

If the Harmony access points are located on the same subnet, an
access point controller can be set to apply rules to any newly
joining Harmony access point. Indeed, we found that when the
controller goes offline, the access points stopped within a few
seconds - they're slaves to the controller.

Proxim also produces an access point in its Skyline product
line, and its characteristics were virtually identical to
Harmony's in performance. The main difference between Skyline
and Harmony is that the Skyline access points can't be managed
by the access point controller.

The Harmony line also includes a proprietary encryption
algorithm that's different from WEP, but Proxim refused to say
how it's different. This encryption method is in addition to
the 54-bit through 128-bit WEP encryption methods available and
common to all the access points we tested.

Another Harmony feature is a forced VPN tunneling method that
can also force logons to a single server. This adds a great
deal of security to mobile networks and could potentially
reduce drive-by logon risks dramatically. Additional security
imposed at the server that is the target of the tunnel requires
the ""drive-bys"" to get past whatever security is imposed at the
server as well.

The Harmony access point controller also supports Remote
Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) for added
authentication, media access control (MAC) layer address
admittance control and SNMP for monitoring. Multicasts can also
be filtered. This helps improve performance on wireless
segments.

While the Harmony line was easiest to set up from a multiple
access point perspective, its ""2X"" performance was
disappointing except in ad hoc mode. Proxim's 2X mode is
designed to operate at a theoretical rate of 108M bit/sec,
approaching the speed of Fast Ethernet. In our testing, we
didn't come close. Worse, we saw a severe drop-off in range in
2X mode, to the point where we had difficulty completing tests
in the 72-foot range. We were disappointed, as we wanted a good
excuse not to wire 100Base-TX.

* Intel

Compared with Proxim's access point, Intel's Pro/Wireless 5000
has no frills. The Pro/Wireless 5000 is managed through a Web
interface. Unlike Proxim and SMC, Intel doesn't have a turbo
mode. The Pro/Wireless 5000 uses a fairly utilitarian setup,
with an ""express"" setup that will be sufficient for most
installations.

The Pro/Wireless 5000 also lacks encryption beyond WEP standard
encryption. This means that the maximum encryption available is
128-bit. While MAC admittance control is available, there's no
provision for RADIUS authentication or any other authentication
capability. Like the other access points tested, the
Pro/Wireless 5000 can be configured as a Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol server.

The Intel access point has fixed antennae. An option is
available to limit the antenna pattern to ""half circle front""
from an omnidirectional pattern, but we found only a nominal
boost in performance when we chose this option. Like the other
access points tested, the Intel unit allows a wide choice of
channels to be chosen. No provision is made for traffic or
protocol filtering.

While slow on performance, it was consistent across the ranges.
We tested the Pro/Wireless 5000 less than the others because it
had no errors and no additional modes to test. Sometimes
""boring"" has its place in connectivity; Intel's product was
consistent and satisfying in its consistency.

Floating Price:

The mean of the arithmetic average of the daily high and low quotations for 
Dated Brent under the heading 'Platt's Crude Oil Marketwire: Brent (DTD)' as 
reported in Platt's Crude Oil Marketwire minus the average of the daily 
settlement prices for the prompt month of the IPE Brent Crude Oil Futures 
Contract for each Commodity Business Day/Trading Day for the applicable 
Determination Period, with the exception of the last Commodity Business 
Day/Trading Day of the prompt month on which day the settlement price for the 
Second Nearby Month will be used.  The calculation should include only the 
days when both the IPE is open and Platts publish their dated Brent 
assessment.

Common Pricing:

Pricing to be effective only on the days when both the IPE is open and Platts 
publish their dated Brent assessment.

Steve,

Thanks a lot for coming to class and talking to us on Tuesday.  
I think your presentation had a strong impact on Rice students, and many of 
them, including me, got a much better idea of Enron and its businesses.

I am not sure if you were going to distribute the copy of your presentation 
to us, but I certainly would consider it useful for my self-education about 
the company.
Let me know if I could possibly get a copy from you.

As I mentioned to you on Tuesday, I am starting full-time at Enron on the 
15th of January as a manager in Research Group, under Vince Kaminski.
I would like for us to go out for lunch sometime in January, if this is OK 
with you.

Sincerely,

Jason Sokolov

1169,"Hi all:

I am glad to announce that due to the great sales results, the
deadline for student tickets to SF Symphony concerts is extended to
10/28/00! So if you missed the previous date, you have more than a week to
sign up! Please see the end of this email for details.
I'll now she my ""wolf-skin"" as a marketer, and share a few personal
notes here re classical music:

-Why classical, when early Beatles is quite cool to my ears?
* Lovely sounds. Such as the strings in a well-played ""Four Seasons"",
or the spacious trumpet sound in John Williams.
* Emotional appeal. You find expressions of emotion that are simply
impossible in words.
* Beauty of composition. A good score is like a maze of accoustic
wonders.
* You already like it. Many of us don't realize how common our
encounter with classical music is. Do you know the title music in Kubrik's
""2000: Space Odyssey"" is from Wagner? Or Hitchcock's music score inspired by
Stravinsky?
* Enjoy pop music more. For example, Pink Floyd.

-Why concerts, when CDs are readily available?
* The sound wth its full depth, and the atmosphere. For those of you
who are not familiar with orchestral music, a concert, where you can relate
the sound to the sight of various instruments working, is the best learning
opportunity. A sense of magic comes from this aural-visual relation. I
myself got hooked to it by reluctantly going to my first LA Philharmonic
concerts when I was in grad school.

-I am still not convinced. Give me one good reason, really...
* Well, even if you hate the concert, the very experience gives you
the ""hands-on"" confidence to say, ""Classical music is bonk""!

Now, details:

Subscribe to the San Francisco Symphony's 2000-2001 season and save up to
60% off full-price tickets!

Subscribing to the San Francisco Symphony as a student means that you
purchase a package of six concerts for half the price. (Subscribe to a 12-
or 24-concert package, and save nearly 60%.) Symphony subscriptions start at
only $14 per concert, and you can purchase two subscriptions with one
student ID.

This year's highlights include:
Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand
Dvorak's Cello Concerto
Ravel's Bolero
MTT's world-renowned interpretations of Stravinsky and Copland

Soloists include:
Violinists Itzhak Perlman and Sarah Chang
Pianists Lang Lang and Andras Schiff
Percussionist Evelyn Glennie

Hayes Valley, the neighborhood surrounding Davies Symphony Hall, is full of
restaurants and bars in every price range to make your evening complete.
BART and MUNI both stop only a few blocks away (and the concerts end by
10pm), so taking public transportation is easy.

Many San Francisco Symphony concerts were sold out last season, but student
subscribers already had these hard-to-get tickets in hand, and they paid
just half-price. To order your tickets or to receive a free brochure, call
Symphony Ticket Services at (415) 864-6000, or visit us online at
sfsymphony.org for information.

Deadline to order: October 28.

1170,"Hi Misty!  How's everything?  Are we on for this weekend?  Let me know.  
Since I have plans to see Lyle Lovett on Fri. night, I was thinking of flying 
in rather than driving Sat. a.m. to save on time & energy, especially since 
you live so close to the airport!

Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S. Open weekend 
before last...drank a lot of beer also.  Am amazed it turned out as well as 
it did.

You said you work with someone named Hamlet, right?  Apparently he used to 
live across the street from Karin and Jim, on Evans!  I didn't think there 
could possibly be 2 Hamlets.  Small world.

1179,"Dear Students,

We are excited to announce that the First Annual Corporate Sponsors 
Reception will be held here at the Haas School of Business on Tuesday, 
October 2, 2001 from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM.

We invite you all to attend and to extend invitations to two managers in 
your organization who have made your studies possible through the provision 
of resources, time, and their enthusiastic support.

We recognize that many of you have class that evening and that your 
managers have busy schedules.  As such, we have developed a two-part 
program for the evening that we hope will accommodate schedules and, 
additionally, provide for your colleagues an evening at Haas that simulates 
your own experience:

      From 6:30 to 7:30 PM, two Haas faculty will give a seminar in Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium on current topics; and from 7:30 to 8:30 PM, a 
reception will be hosted in the Bank of America Forum.  You and your 
managers are invited to attend either or both halves of the evening.

We do request that you RSVP for this event and specify what portion of the 
evening you and your guests will be attending.

We will have printed invitations for you to distribute to your 
managers.  We anticipate that they will be in the program office for you to 
pick up during the week of September 17.

The Evening Program, and the Haas School as a whole, is excited to welcome 
your managers to the campus.

     Welcome back to Turkey.
      I hope the weath weather is better in Turkey than here as it has been
cold for spring.  Temps in the 50's during the day and while we have had some
sunny days there has been plenty of rain.  I have been busy with my Golden
""K"" Club (Senior Citizen Kiwanis).  We help with a picnic for mentally
retarded children, read to needy preschool children, help at mentally
retarded track meet, go to weekly meetings and etc.  I am told May is the
busiest month and it has been but it is almost finished.
     Mother and I have been watching the weather in Italy and imagining what
the two of you are doing.  Sue is back and catching up on their business.
This week besides Foundry work they have Visited an honorary dinner for one
of Jeff's college professors.   They are also doing some major work  on their
house.   The Sweeps are over at WGN-TV for a while so now Tom is looking
forward to his trip to Alaska a week from Thursday.  Jeff is still busy with
the gas problems so we hear little from him.  I hear Peter Widman is getting
married.  Though nothing definite I hear it will be in the fall.
     Nothing else for now.  Let us hear from you.   In the meantime  WE SEND
BOTH OF YOU  LOTS of LOVE and KISSES    MOTHER and DAD

1189,"
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

Subject:	RE: Re Ivanhoe E.S.D

Just a couple of additional thoughts,  the cost estimate for ESD mods of $130,000 will typically be, about 25% more.  The E&C costs,  company overheads and construction support will increase these costs to around $170,000.  I did talk with Fred this morning and will relay the highlights of our conversation.  

The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 35 - 50 mmcfd.  The gas supply is from the Leedy Plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects.  The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at Ivanhoe.  The gas end up with NNG on the North side of the lateral,  this Lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve.  The 2 units at Ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG.  Since they have not run in some time, its probable to spend an additional $300,000 to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices.  Then we would most likely have to design and resize the units for an additional guess of $350,000.

In order to abandon these units, I would recommend we abandon in place or Plant Held For Future Use.  My guess is about $15 - 25,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units.  I do know that there is some drilling going on in the area,  I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any different than the current status.

Let us know your comments.

Please, keep in mind, that the members of the Research Group
who stayed behind to facilitate the transition will be leaving

Does the state have copies of all programs?  Should systems manage the migration?  Muller was going to send vince the copy of the contract indicating the section to vince that required the turnover just to make sure we were doing the right thing - did that happen?

Jeff -

Jean and the boys will be heading to my parents for X-Mas on 12/17.  I am in
Houston until the morning of the 21st, and would love to get together for 
dinner
sometime during that interval.

Are you scheduled to be in town during that period?  If so give me a call at
713.653.8207 (day) or at home at 713.522.9381.  I'll also be happy fill you in
on what happened at the MFAH subcomittee meeting today as well.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.  
   
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 

Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 

Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., ""with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion."" 

Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 

David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 

But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 

Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 

State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on ""shaky 
calculations."" 

To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 

The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 

The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 

The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's ""Big Five"" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 

The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 

The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February:

Subject:  Confidential

Apparently our local counsel in Puerto Rico had a small ""change of heart""
as to the transfer restrictions for San Juan Gas, Procaribe and Progasco.
Although the statute does not contain a change of control provision with
respect to the licenses, it appears that after carefully looking into this
issue, local counsel found out that the Puerto Rican authorities are taking
a very aggressive approach with respect to transfers of control of holders
of licenses.  Apparently the Puerto Rican authorities argue that the spirit
of the statute is to extend the requirement of prior authorization for
transfers of the licenses, to a change of control of the operator.  In his
response to Bill Weiland from V&E he advised that it would be more prudent
to request permission to change control of the company that holds the
license.

1206,"Attached is ""Annex B.doc"" which we use to prepare Annex B which contains the 
credit provisions we attach to a Confirmation when such is requested for 
omnibus financial confirmations.  About mid-way through the US Annex B is 
about 4 selections of collateral annexes depending on whether the credit is 
one-way or two-way and whether the collateral requested is letters of credit 
only or letters of credit and cash.  Following that is form of letter of 
credit.  We have an Annex B form for US counterparties and Canadian 
counterparties.  I have attached both.   The law in Canada currently does not 
favor taking cash in Canada and WE DO NOT TAKE CASH (this obviously is quite 
problematic for us!).  Our current advice from Canadian counsel is that Cash 
must be perfected in a way similar to filing a UCC.  The Canadian and US 
lawyers are re-reviewing this situation and I will let you know when/if this 
advice changes.

I talked to Chris last week during a recruiting event that Analyst and Associate pool hosted at Rice.
He was very interested in the kinds of projects that our group is working on.  Also, he has had an 
extensive experience in the Energy industry.
I am attaching his resume.  He has one more year left in school, but If you are interested, I could 
invite him over to talk to our group members, and get a better feel for the Enron Research environment.

Jason,

I enjoyed our discussions last Thursday....much more interesting that the usual partio-MBA schmooze stuff.  I would very much like to talk to your Director about opportunities at Enron.  To be honest, I am approaching Enron from several different points in order to pinpoint the area that best suits my abilities and sense of direction (kind of mirroring the internal process that you would use to move between groups within Enron).  As Enron is the only large corporation that I am seriously considering, talks with people such as yourself are invaluable in helping me find areas of commonality between the company's and my own goals.  Makes for a realistic set of expectations on both sides.

My resume is attached in Word format, but sending emails from home via the Rice server sometimes buggers the attachments.  If you can't open the document, let me know and I will send another copy both from my Roadrunner address as well as directly from school.

Thanks for the help.

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)
2/28/1 18:56 (New York)

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)

     (Adds names of California generators in fifth paragraph, and
Reliant comment in sixth.)

     New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partial
payment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities this
summer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-door
meeting with the governor said.
     ``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the
companies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone,
a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meeting
in New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar.
That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.''
      PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
utilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12
billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices.
Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power-
buying debt to consumers.
     Davis said some generators have approached him with offers to
accept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utility
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35
analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York in
a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were
not allowed to attend.

                        No Names Mentioned

    Davis didn't specify which companies came to him with partial-
payment proposals, analysts said. Duke Energy Corp., Calpine
Corp., Willams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. are among
the biggest suppliers of electricity to California utilities.
    ``I'm not aware of him talking to anyone at Duke about
forgiveness,'' Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said.
      Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Davis's proposal
``doesn't really come as a surprise'' because politicians in
Sacramento, the capital of California, have been discussing the
idea for weeks. Reliant has opposed anything other than full
payment of its debts.
    ``Williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owed
us,'' spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said. ``We have worked in
very good faith with the state, selling voluntarily into the
market, negotiating with them for long-term contracts and working
with them to solve the problem.''
      Enron Corp., an energy trader that has set aside unspecified
reserve for possible losses in California, has not been approached
about debt forgiveness, said Karen Denne, a company spokeswoman.
      ``This proposal. . . is news to us,'' and does not address
the immediate problem of electricity shortages in California this
summer, Denne said. Industry analysts say California, which has
already had scattered blackouts this winter, will face more this
summer when power demand surges.

                     Buying the Grid

     Davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy PG&E
Corp.'s power transmission system may take another 30 days, though
he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks,
analysts said. He offered few other specifics on the PG&E talks,
said Steve Fetter, group managing director of global power for
Fitch Inc.
     State officials are trying to reach agreement with PG&E and
Edison, as well as with Sempra Energy, to buy their transmission
lines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money at
low interest rates to avoid bankruptcy. A tentative agreement to
buy Edison's lines for $2.76 billion was reached last week. Talks
with Sempra are continuing.
     The governor said he was optimistic an agreement with PG&E
could be reached in two weeks, but negotiations could drag on
longer, Fetter said.
       ``We are making progress,'' Davis said at a news conference
after the analysts meeting at the Cornell Club on the east side of
Manhattan. ``We are close to a final agreement with (Edison) and
relatively close with Sempra.''
      The governor told analysts he's confident he can get a
utility rescue plan that doesn't require an immediate rate
increase, but Davis did say that rate increases are going to be
needed at some unspecified time in the future, Fetter said.
    Davis said he wasn't sure if he resolved all of analysts'
doubts about California's plans to save its utilities from
bankruptcy.
    ``He's in a hole and he's got a long way to go to get out of
it,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston who attended the meeting. ``We still don't have a final
solution in sight.''
     Shares of San Francisco-based PG&E fell 9 cents to $13.96.
Rosemead, California-based Edison shares fell 4 cents to $14.90.
San Diego-based Sempra fell 16 cents to $22.15.

Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks

1226,"Kay -- Just some housekeeping questions:

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want 
us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process 
of sorting out the ""Costs"" definition so that it works better with the other 
parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board 
meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately 
need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that 
meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until 
their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done 
this week and have them call a special Board meeting.  They have done this in 
the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this 
by May 31.

Thanks -- David

it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

1233,"Jeff,

Hi there......sounds like Penny has been equally emphatic on both sides
about meeting...

So sorry not to have responded earlier ...it has been such a completely
psychotic week for me. I have been in London and Stockholm this week - I
don't think I slept more than 3 hours a night all week. I am on my way
tomorrow to India (Bombay and Bangalore)...London on Thursday...and back to
New York on Thursday night or Friday morning. Friday and Saturday (April 13
& 14) are fairly free for me - would Friday night work for you?

It will be difficult for me to reach you from India- given schedule and time
difference, but I will be accessing email. I can be reached on a mobile
number in Europe on today and on Thursday - ++44 7990 973 620. As of Friday
- in New York, the best place to reach me is on - 1 917 862 6552. By the
way, how is the Peninsula post-renovations? I liked it before the
renovations - am sure its even more wonderful.

Hi Elizabeth,

I'm Penny and Sam Britell's friend (Sam's from college) who have
mentioned (truthfully, insisted) that we should get together for a drink
next time I'm in NYC.
I'll be in new york sunday the 7th through the 14th and would love to
get together for that drink Penny and Sam keep telling me about.
Fortunately I have a pretty open schedule next week, so if you have any
time, I'd like to meet you.

I'll be staying at the Penninsula next week, or feel free to call me on
my cell phone at 713 854 4952.  As well, I'll be checking voicemail in
the office (713) 853 1761.

I'll be out of the office the next two days, but leave a message if you
have time.

Tom,

For East Power, when you do your extract, you should select ""commodity"" only as the deal category so you will not pick up any capacity positions, as they are included in neither Var nor our position reports.  Also, you should query by delivery point and exclude all of the following delivery points (region codes in parentheses) as they are ancillary and credit positions and not energy positions, per se:

10 Min Spinning (R1J)
10 Min Non-Spinning (R1K)
30 Min Op Reserve (R1L)
Op Cap (R1N)
Renewable Energy Credits (R6R)
Regulation Up (R6W)
Regulation Down (R6X)
Responsive Reserve (R6Y)
Non-Spinning Reserve (R6Z)

Let me know if you have any questions!

2)Yes, except South America is not in EnPower yet.  The portfolio is set up, but no transactions are captured there.
3) The West looks close but the East is completely off.  Also, AlbertaENA should not be zero.
4) RetailEast & RetailWest are test Portfolios and should not be included!

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.

1246,"Diana, since I wasn't involved in her first raise, I really couldn't say what 
the nature of it was.  You may be right that the 13th month is the 
complicating factor, but it should be a matter of record what her base salary 
is (that is what we are paying her).  The raise should be applied to whatever 
her base salary is.  If it is 72K, then it is 72K. We need to make sure, 
however, that we are not giving her an overlapping raise to the one ENA gave 
her.

Mark, could you give me a call on Monday?  We need to sort this out asap so 
that we can get her raise in place.  

Thanks,

Subject: A.Calo

There seems to be some confusion on Andrea Calo's salary.  Year end records 
show her annual salary at $65,000 (5000 x 13mos).   I then was advised that 
her salary was $72,000 (6000 x 12mos) effective December. Not $78,000 
effective 1/1 as indicated below. 
What I think is happening is that the 13th month is confusing the situation.
The other question is why would we raise her salary on January 1 and give her 
a merit increase on 2/1 ?  We really should be doing an equity adjustment and 
merit on the same date if this is the situation. 

Andrea's merit was approved at 9% based on annual salary of $72,000 (not 
$78,000)...

Pls advise your thoughts and what communications have already taken place 
with Andrea.

"
1247,"Classmates,

The reunion is rapidly approaching!  I think we have been able to get ahold
of just about everyone now, and it looks like there will be a very big
turn-out ... thanks for taking the time to let us know your plans!!   Also,
special thanks to Constantine for doing a bang-up job on recruiting,
especially among the New York contingent!

Now that we have gotten the word out, its time to collect a few bucks to pay
for these great events!  If you haven't already submitted your Registration
you can do so in one of at least two ways:

1)  Return the flyer from the Alumni Office that you received in the mail.
This has pricing for all the events and should be received in plenty of time
if you send it this week or early next.   Note:  if you didn't get the
packet, then you probably need to update your info on the alumni database --
go to http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/.

2)  Register Online by going to the Reunion Homepage at
http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/reunions.html  (note:  this is a link to
the main Reunion site with info on all events).   There is a secure form
there with all the pricing, info and a credit card processing function.
Nice!

Either way should work, please note that you will only be able to do the
Online Registration through Oct 31st so please get on it!

Couple of points of clarification regarding the pricing and events!

1)  You will see reference to two separate events happening the same
weekend, the Alumni Conference and the various Class Reunions (1996, 1991,
1986, etc)!   Just think of all these events as one series of activities
designed for your reunioning pleasure and pick and choose what you would
like to attend w/ special attention to anything that says ""Class of 1996"".
For a list of all events, visit the Reunion web site (link shown above).

2)  You will notice that there are two BBQ lunches on Saturday.  There is a
Class of 1996 event at Will Rogers State Park, and there is a separate event
on the North Lawn at UCLA for everyone else.  You can attend either event
(or both for that matter), but I would encourage you to go to the Class of
1996 event because that is where all of your friends will be!

3)  Pricing for the events is listed on the Registration page, but a quick
summary is as follows (simplified version):

Conference Events
---------------------------
Beer Bust (Fri night) - $15/person    Note:  All classes will attend
Building Your Knowledge Portfolio I (Fri day) - $75/person
Building Your Knowledge Portfolio II (Sat day) - $50/person
Alumni BBQ Picnic (Sat day) - $10/person

Reunion Events
--------------------------
Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic (Sat day) - $15/person
Class of 1996 Reunion Dinner (Sat night) - $65/person
Class of 1996 Golf Tourney (Sun day) - $65/person

Package Pricing
--------------------------
Alumni Conference package - $135/person - includes Beer Bust, 2-Days of
Knowledge Portfolio and Alumni BBQ Picnic***
Alumni Conference + Reunion Events - $TBD/person    Note:  this isn't listed
yet, but should be on the site shortly ~$270/person

***Important:  If you buy the Alumni Conference package, which includes a
ticket to the Alumni BBQ Picnic, go ahead and use the ticket to attend the
Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic!   Keep the extra $5 and buy Constantine a beer for
us okay!

4)  The Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic starts at 11:30am and is located at Will
Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades.  Please note that this is different
from Will Rogers State Beach.  The park is located North of Sunset Blvd.
between Amalfi Drive & Chautauqua.  Should be very warm and a great location
for a BBQ!!

Hope this information is helpful, please let us know if you need more!   In
the mean time, the planning continues and we hope this is a great event!

Looking forward to seeing you in LA!!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many, many Reunion Organizers

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I spent several hours with TJ shadowing and we tested the 402 code while I examined results.  As each error or incorrect result was noted, we went to the code and walked through and made changes.  TJ is now running actual dates and we will check them in the morning.  When all is well, we will run the rest of October.  Next we will perform the same testing and coding revisions for 405 (only need to test for EPMI-side exceptions) and then we will be able to run 405 for the month.

After the latest unsuccessful run of 403, I delved into the specific details of the variances, and all of the material volumes are included in the Finals, so any allocations that would be created as a result of those variances would be reversed when I run the Final actualization.  So, this morning I manually calculated appropriate allocations for our Load customers (the variances are due to re-submitted meter data), entered the values in the ProRata allocation table, created an additional allocation for the remaining 1.9496MW variance, matched all up to the ISO, and completed 403 for Preliminaries.

I have actualized the regular stuff and set to M through October 27.  I will wrap those up on Friday.

At this point in time we are on target for completion of Prelims by Friday afternoon, but Finals may not be done until Monday.

Anna and I worked through the coding for 403 and she made some changes to the method for finding percent usage.  I reran the tool and looked at the results and we still do not have valid allocations.  On October 1, we now have an 877MW difference between the variance and the amount allocated.  Will look into it again tomorrow.

402 is nearly complete.  Ran into an error while running a test day, and I will discuss it with TJ tomorrow.  405 should be a quick fix once we get the 402 exceptions working properly.

I have actualized finals on the regular charges through October 23, and should be able to wrap up most, if not all, of the rest tomorrow.

If we can get them working properly tomorrow, then I will be able to finish the Prelims on Friday, and the Finals on Monday.

Exception handling coding changes are nearly complete.  TJ had to weave through the code for 402 all the way, as well as add 3 new function points: EPMI exceptions, ISO exceptions, and repeating (scavenging, he calls it) the exception roll up function from another module.  He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations, EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions.  He has not yet done the 'scavenging' part.  He will be finished with 402 tonight, and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions.

The part of 405 that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling, which should be a much less involved endeavor.  

For 403, I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance, and how that variance was being allocated.  However, these queries are currently beyond my expertise (I plan to rectify that).  We are going to enlist Anna's help as much as possible for 403, and get to the bottom of what is happening.  As a side note, for the time change date, we have an extra HE 2, and the ISO has HE 25.  We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that.

For the regular actualizations, I have set 10/1 - 10/18 (except 10/16) to M today.  There is a strange anomaly going on on the 16th, and neither Donna nor I could figure out what.  I will get back to it.

Anticipate completion of all by Monday, May 7.

Exception handling in 402 and 405 not coded properly.   Tj working on enhancing the codes to handle them correctly, and anticipates being done with 402 by tomorrow afternoon, and 405 by mid-day Wednesday.

Final actualizations for the regular charge codes are complete and set to M through October 10.

Will perform additional research into the improper allocations for 403 on Tuesday.  The unallocated volume on 10/1 is approx 300MW, so I will focus my research on that day.

Estimate completion date of all (deviations, prelim and final, and regular charge codes, final) Monday, May 7.

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

1264,"I have the Manual Entry process ready for testing again (testing as in testing by the analysts).  I would prefer to have it used by the analysts at least for a few days to iron out any more potential ""bugs"" before releasing it to users on the floor.  If the consensus is to have people on the floor be the testers, that is fine as well, as long as they know that the following URL points to a development server.

Without further ado, the link to the Manual Entry Page:

http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

As stated in the above URL, this is located on the DEVELOPMENT web server.  Users should honestly never be directed to this URL, unless authorized by one of the site developers, since anything on it is subject to be currently in development (read: potentially broken).

Anyway, here are some things that have been added to the Manual Entry piece in this release:

""Previous"" data now reflects information in the DB for the latest effective date for the selected cycle (not just ""Yesterday"" as before)...
There is now an option to enter data for a ""special cycle 0""...this is to be used on occasions where no data was scraped (for whatever reason), but there is some available that can be manually entered.  Selecting this option causes ALL points for a given pipeline to be displayed (both normally scraped points AND manually entered points).  A cycle of '0' is applied to this data, and it should only show up on reports until valid scrape data becomes available (since the report engine is designed to pull the latest cycle available).
You can now add ""extra"" line items to be stored in the DB...this is to be used when you must enter data for more than one flow type for a given point (i.e. the point is reported as both a Receipt and a Delivery).  This should normally only have to be done the first time data is entered for that pipe, since the ""Previous"" data will handle pulling in and displaying (the next time) every flow type stored for every point on the pipe.

NOTE:  It is set to only allow 1 extra point to be added...this was done to simplify the handling of this feature; I'm open to discussion if you feel there is a need to enter more than one extra point (I see it as a Receipt/Delivery issue...will a point ever be more than that?  Receipt/Delivery/Storage or something?)

I have also fixed the ""Exceptions Occurred"" bug that cropped up recently...this was caused by moving the manually entered points to their own unique pipeline ids.  The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that, but it is updated now.

Aside from the above, minor tweaks here and there have also been made.  I am going to enlist the aid of Junellen to ""beautify"" the layout, but provided no more bugs appear during testing this should be good to go into production by the beginning of next week.

Any questions, feel free to ask or reply.

Thanks,
Chris

I know that you are doing all that you can to help the Company and its people survive.  
 
The way we face great difficulty is the measure of our lives.  You have not run.  God will give you the strength to get thru this.
 
I know that Enron is not just a business for you, it is a dream .. a dream you have seen almost fulfilled.  I believe 'others' were sent to you to do harm .. and that they corrupted your dream.  It's a story as old as life itself.  
 
Ask God for His wisdom, His help, Hisbenediction. 
 
You are not alone Ken.

Subject:	FW: California Update--9.02.01

?	On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
?	The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
?	Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
?	The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
?	In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own ""date certain"" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
?	The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
?	We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
?	We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Governor Ridge might call Ken Lay today

I just received a call from Bob O'Dell (215-569-5312) following up on the 
request from Mayor Edward Rendell regarding the upcoming Millennium 
Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show and Philadelphia 2000.  The Mayor has 
asked Enron for a $750,000 commitment.  As outlined in my December 6th memo 
-- the breakdown of the commitment was for Enron to contribute $500,000 for 
the Millennium Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show on December 31, 1999.  The 
$250,000 would be credited to Philadelphia 2000 Convention package.  The 
Mayor and Mr. Lay have spoken several weeks ago but no commitment was made at 
the time.  Will we be sponsoring the event?

Also, Bob gave us the heads up --- that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be 
calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the 
Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC 
in February 2000.

Please let me know if you need additional information.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Maryellen Feaster

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.

I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.
RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

07/10/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
B-1
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company



SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse
group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis,
who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records
show.


During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid
to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by
the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.


Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas
& Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a
megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC
Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP.


In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period.
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour,
according to an analysis of the documents.


The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power
emergencies.


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.


""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said.


""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the
generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400%
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are
charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are
getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.""


The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times
on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first
quarter.


The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in
the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the
state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not
limited to a few generators.


Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the
year. ""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in
costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January.


The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316
in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per
hour to $271, the reports show.


In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron,
one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state,
a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.


By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.


A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of
Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not
be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the
past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.


A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to
see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be
reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of
producing the power needed by the state were extremely high.


More Power Bought Than Projected


Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.


Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.


Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply
problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell
short of state projections in June and early July.


The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well
under $100 a megawatt-hour.


A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term
power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry
closer to normalcy.""

1282,"They are aware that the Broward County Tax Appraiser will assess the property and that as most industrial facilities, the equipment is subject to depreciation.  The City's millage rate has remained fairly constant (stagnant growth), but as the tax base increases, they expect the millage rate to decrease.  The City is looking for a fixed annual revenue stream of $1.5 - 1.726 mm (similar to Pompano's 1.5 mm).
 
After we have all had a chance to review the doc - it would be good to have a conference call to discuss.  We're targetting to get a draft to the City early next week.

decrease as a function of depreciation we thought the way to maintain the 
constant we to increase the 650k at the same rate as the depreciation.

cracks online.  Although it is from a small base, this business continues to 
grow.  This business we are doing is also better than the NYMEX look-a-like 
business in that we are developing a mix of counterparties who are paying the 
bid/offer. Today's counterparties included Valero, Hess, Cargill and Bank of 
America. 

Next week we will launch our NYMEX heat and gas crack products.  Many of our 
counterparties have expressed interest in this product so we believe our 
volumes will continue to grow.

1287,"Dr. Harris:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt 
mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class 
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a ""special testing status"" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.  When I hear back from GMAC, I am 
planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon.

      Station   PBS

      Program   The Newshour With Jim Lehrer


              Ray Suarez, co-anchor:

              Finally, it's the latest hot idea for reducing energy
              costs.  Twenty-three states have enacted legislation to
              deregulate electricity rates and sixteen others are
              thinking about it, but California's pioneering efforts have
              already provoked an angry consumer backlash.  Spencer
              Michaels reports.

              Spencer Michaels reporting:

              In a San Diego strip mall, the owner of the tiny Youngling
              Oriental Vegetarian Market is having a hard time.  Yuman
              (?) Young owes two thousand dollars to San Diego Gas &
              Electric--SDG&E--an amount he can't come up with.  Like
              many San Diegans, his electricity bill has skyrocketed this
              year.

              So this is your bill in March, right?

              Yuman Young (Youngling Oriental Vegetarian Market):  Right.

              Michaels:  And the bill is--

              Young:  And see, in March, the bill comes to about four
              seventy-eight.

              Michaels:  Then we have May.

              Young:  In May, it...

              Michaels:  Then we're up--

              Young:  ...goes to six seventy something.

              Michaels:  Six seventy-four.

              Young:  Yeah.

              Michaels:  And then--

              Young:  And then...

              Michaels:  And then we skip...

              Young:  ...we skip a month.

              Michaels:  ...June, but in July--

              Young:  And the--then in July, it goes to about thirteen
              hundred dollars.

              Michaels:  Thirteen hundred dollars?

              Young:  Yeah.

              Michaels:  And the same in August?

              Young:  And the same in August.

              Michaels:  Over thirteen hundred dollars.

              Young:  Yeah, right.

              Michaels:  Young's main electricity expense is his frozen
              food freezer that he keeps at minus seventeen degrees.  But
              people without such appliances have seen residential and
              commercial bills double and triple as well.  San Diego is
              the first California city to suffer the effects of the
              deregulation of electricity, which was enacted by the state
              legislature in 1996.  The theory was that by taking away
              the monopolies enjoyed by state-regulated utility
              companies, like SDG&E, new competition among electricity
              producers would result in a drop in rates.  But since such
              simple market economics would take awhile, the legislature
              imposed a temporary rate freeze to protect most parts of
              the state from higher prices.  In San Diego, the freeze
              came off this year letting the market set the price, a
              very high price.  SDG&E is owned by Sempra Energy, where
              Stephen Baum is CEO.

              Stephen Baum (Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy):
              It's been a terrible shock to our customers, seeing
              real-time prices for the first time.  And those prices are
              way out of sight because the wholesale market is broken and
              needs to be fixed.

              Michaels:  The vast wholesale market is something new.
              California utilities used to own most of the power plants,
              the high-voltage transmission lines and the system to
              deliver power to homes and businesses.  Under deregulation
              the utilities still deliver the power, but had to turn
              operations of the transmission lines over to a state
              agency.  In addition, they had to sell their power plants.
              So now almost all power is sold to the utilities on a
              wholesale basis by producers or generators.  And according
              to Baum, they charge what they can get.

              Baum:  There's been a very large wealth transfer from the
              customers in the state of California to the generators.  We
              don't think the market's workably competitive.  There
              aren't enough players and there's not enough generation.
              Until that occurs, you're going to have dislocations at
              very high prices.

              Michaels:  The situation keeps getting worse as
              California's population keeps increasing, especially in the
              hot central valley.  Air conditioners and other appliances
              put a strain on a system already stressed by increased
              demand in other states where some of California's power
              comes from.  According to University of California
              economist Severin Borenstein, deregulation has aggravated
              the already tight situation.

              Severin Borenstein (University of California, Berkeley):
              Production in the state has really been stretched and that
              does two things:  One, is it naturally just creates a tight
              supply/demand situation that's going to drive prices up.
              The other thing it does, though, is it also puts the
              producers in a very strong position to push prices up even
              higher.  And, I think, there's no question the generators
              are trying to make as much money as they can.

              Michaels:  Duke Energy, headquartered in North Carolina, is
              one of the new generators in the California market.  Duke
              spokesman Tom Williams says much of its power was sold
              before prices rose and that profits are plowed back into
              new plants.

              The utilities and the consumer groups seem to think that
              the generators are making a lot of money on this crisis.
              Is that true?

              Tom Williams (Duke Energy Corporation):  Duke Energy sells
              the bulk of its power in the--in the forward market.  It
              was sold a year ago for the plants we have in the state
              now.  So the power's already been sold, and the price of
              natural gas has gone up two and a half times since last
              summer.  So there is a very tight supply situation, but
              we're reinvesting our profits back into the market to fix
              the problem.
              Michaels:  In fact, Duke is investing 1.1 billion dollars
              to modernize two inefficient power plants it bought from
              the utilities.  As part of the deal it also had to buy
              this old PG&E plant in Oakland, which has been running
              overtime because of the power shortage.  Over the last two
              decades only a few companies have actually begun
              construction of new power plants because of what they saw
              as the uncertainties of the regulatory climate.  This plant
              near San Francisco, being built by Calpine, will supply
              enough electricity for half a million homes.  It will be
              ready by next summer.  Calpine vice president, James
              Macias, says his company predicted the shortage of power
              and took a risk.

              James Macias (Vice President, Calpine):  You could see the
              fundamentals forming of the need for more--more power.
              There hasn't been a big power plant like this built in the
              state for--for decades.

              Michaels:  Macias says the utilities should have contracted
              for power at lower rates before it was actually needed.  He
              expects that the profits power companies are making now
              will decline as more power comes on line.

              Macias:  We're doing pretty good.  We're being rewarded for
              having the vision and the foresight to come in here and
              build this--this--this needed supply.  But they're not
              going to last.  As soon as this--more of the supply comes
              in, the prices will come down and they'll be--they'll be
              depressed again.  They have to come down.  This economy,
              again, can't support these high prices.

              Michaels:  Although twenty new plants are in the planning
              stages, it takes five years to design and build just one.
              With very little additional supply in the immediate
              pipeline, the director of San Diego's utility watchdog
              group, Utility Consumers Action Network, says regulators
              must get involved to return rates to reasonable levels.

              Michael Shames (Consumer Advocate):  They could have
              immediately put--reinstated a price cap.  They could have
              immediately said, hold on a second folks.  We're not going
              to tolerate this.  We're not going to see a region like San
              Diego thrust into a depression.

              Michaels:  But Michael Shames says some legislators and
              regulators were ruled by their uncompromising belief in a
              free-market ideology.

              Shames:  There were a number of people, well-placed people,
              who were so ideologically driven to force competition to
              work in a market such as energy that they didn't want to
              look at the signs when they saw that the experiment wasn't
              working.  They didn't want to acknowledge it wasn't
              working, and they were prepared to sacrifice a city, San
              Diego, a state, California, and possibly a country, in
              order to see their ideologically driven vision--vision
              work.  (Clip from a TV commercial)

              Michaels:  Shames' consumer group was so outraged at the
              price increases they bought TV ads and urged civil
              disobedience.

              Dianne Jacob (Chair, San Diego County Supervisor):  Join me
              and other San Diegans and let's send a message.  Pay only
              what is fair.  When your SDG&E bill comes, pay what you
              paid last summer.  That's fair.

              Michaels:  At the California Public Utilities Commission,
              President Loretta Lynch agrees that regulators could remedy
              the situation, but she says it's not up to the state.
              Only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the power
              to cut back prices.

              Loretta Lynch (California Public Utilities Commission):  If
              the federal government allowed power plant owners to make a
              reasonable profit instead of an excessive profit, then that
              would drop the price of wholesale power.  And if that price
              dropped we would not be in the pickle we're in today.

              Michaels:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission president,
              James Hoecker, replies that simply using price controls
              discourages investment in an industry that needs it.

              James Hoecker (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission):  What
              my friend, President Lynch, has said reflects a kind of
              thinking that markets can never be made to work and that
              ultimately we have to resort to cost-based, profit kinds of
              regulation of utilities.  And I think that this market has
              marched past that as an option.

              Michaels:  In November, the Federal Energy Regulatory
              Commission proposed a major change.  Utilities would not be
              required to buy power from the power exchange--a kind of
              stock market for electricity where prices have soared.
              Instead, the utilities will be able to buy directly from
              producers.  The federal agency has launched an
              investigation into California's troubles, hoping for a
              long-term solution.

              Unidentified Woman:  This legislation, today, has the
              ability to provide immediate and real relief to San
              Diegans.

              Michaels:  The California legislature struggled this year
              with what to do, short term, for the people of San Diego.
              The debate centered around a proposal to cap electricity
              bills at sixty-five dollars a month, retroactive to June 1.

              Charlene Zettel (Assembly Member, Republican, San Diego):
              What is San Diego's problem today will be California's
              problem tomorrow.

              Rico Oller (Assembly Member, Republican, San Diego):  You
              know who we can thank for this problem?  You want to get
              right down to brass tacks?  You can thank all of the
              knuckle-headed people in this legislature and in
              government, in general--in general, who have stood in the
              way of doing the smart and sensible thing that anyone would
              have the sense to do in the real world, and that is to
              provide for their future needs by increasing production.
              We need to build some facilities to produce power.

              Unidentified Man:  All debate having ceased, the clerk will
              open the roll.  All members vote who desire to vote.

              Michaels:  The San Diego rate cap passed, but the state is
              still far from a solution.  Higher electric rates are
              forecasted for the rest of the state as the caps come off
              in other cities.  And even more troubling is the fact that
              the price rollback is being bankrolled by the utilities,
              since they still have to pay the generators for the power
              but can't pass those prices on to their customers.

              Economist Borenstein says other states better examine
              California's experience before proceeding with
              deregulation.

              Borenstein:  I think most states that are deregulating
              right now, if they have a tight supply situation, are very
              likely to see spikes just like ours.  The best advice I
              think for most of these states is to take a break, not move
              forward on their deregulation, watch the experiments that
              are going on in California and New York and Pennsylvania
              and Texas and a number of other states and learn from them,
              because we're learning a lot from them as we do this.

              Michaels:  The success or failure of deregulation across
              the country will depend partly on easy access to power
              transmission lines so that electricity can be transferred
              more readily to where it's needed.  The federal government
              is working on that problem.

"
1306,"Jeff--you did such a good job that I don't have to type much.   I do have a 
few other thoughts to share that may be helpful for the California folks.

The format, although somewhat informal, had a  court reporter present and 
transcripts will be published. Each state was invited to have 2 
representatives and one of the 2 had to be a Commission member.  Opening 
comments were taken from each state and then specific topics were discussed.  
Herzberg participated primarily in the opening discussion. 

He came across as very sincere---indicated that they were working ""around the 
clock"" to take care of their problems, but that they cannot do it alone.  He 
asked for FERC to help get Califonia to ""stabilization"" and specifically 
asked FERC for three actions:  an 18 month temporary price cap on 
electricity,  an 18 month temporary price cap on natural gas prices and to 
prohibit any withholding of pipeline capacity to California.  

He was treated very respectfully (which was not as evident  in the comments 
to Commissioner Brown), and I think he did his cause some good.  Much more so 
that in other venues when I've seen other reps from Davis's office speak.  
Breathitt came to California's defense at some point in the discussion.

Commissioner Brown did his share of ranting about EVERYBODY knowing that 
market manipulation is taking place and that the bastards were going to pay 
for their misdeeds (ok..he didn't use those words, but his message was clear)

Lastly, the Chair of the Montana was the most vocal and honest in his 
comments to the California partcipants stating, in part,  ""why should Montana 
ratepayers be taking the hit because California didn't build power plants.""

Greetings:

Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what 
happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the 
following.

Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California 
it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC 
Commissioner).  

Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's 
doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who 
can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that 
FERC do ""its part"" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.

Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.

Overall, the ""no price cap"" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be 
under considerable pressure to give in to caps).

The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 
9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the 
letter.

Best,
Jeff

when
   i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have
info
   on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to
try
   seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
   helpful

   i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
   weekend unfortunately....

   i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
   and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
   night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
   do!

   the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
you
   never know.

   my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
   sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
believe
   me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
could
   get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

   ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
   definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
friday.
   the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
anytime
   on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a

   Hi Bonnie,

   How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
have
   been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
riding
   public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might

   some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
One
   of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend
in
   your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
   still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
   like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
   for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
   offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
live
   in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
a
   research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
for
   restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
   maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

1320,"Bankruptcy 101

In an effort to educate employees about the nuts and bolts of bankruptcy, Enron is sponsoring five Bankruptcy 101 sessions next week. These sessions will focus on the basics of the bankruptcy process in general (not Enron specific).

When:	 Monday, January 28th - Friday, February 1st  from noon until 1:00 daily
Where:  5C2 in Enron Center North

Each session is limited to 50 participants, so you must RSVP if you would like to attend. Simply select a button above to indicate the date you would like to attend. You will then be sent a confirmation email. Note: This does not automatically post your calendar.  The sessions will be filling up quickly--so don't delay in reserving your spot!

"
1321,"The RTO advocacy effort is off to a good start.  As you recall, I sent out a request for information last week to a few of you in the field asking for the following:

a summary of the stakeholders who are raising concerns with the FERC RTO model
an outline of their arguments/criticisms/concerns, and 
a list of priority issues that need addressing

The feedback was tremendous, and it included useful comments in regard to how we might better improve the delivery of our RTO message.
 
Due to the increasing concerns and waivering support among Members of Congress, Governors, state utility commissions, legislators and other stakeholder groups in regard to the FERC RTO model it is imperative that we develop a sound strategy and strong arguments around the RTO issue.  
 
Toward that end, I have summarized your comments and am coordinating with our friends at Tabors Caramanis and Frontier Economics on the development of materials that can be used in your upcoming meetings with stakeholders.  
 
The first set of documents will address the following issues:

A side-by-side graphic of the FERC RTO model v. the utility 17+ RTOs accompanied by an explanation of power flows that builds on Tabors Caramanis work on natural markets which support the FERC model.
Reliability Document - this document will start with a brief history of the NY blackouts, the state's inability to deal with reliability and how and why the federal government became involved, the role of NERC.  The synopsis will finally address the red herrings associated with reliability issues and the benefits to reliability as a result of implementing the FERC model.  It will also briefly address control issues for states and real-time reliability.
Economics - This summary will show examples of historical cost savings of aggregation; it will highlight cost savings potential, and also identify peculiar left-over costs of how certain systems grew and the costs were never eradicated.
The Hit List - This document will address issues such as environmental arguments; eminent domain; implementation issues; cost shifts to people during transitions; infrastructure/software concerns; and other issues that are raised as a reasons not to implment the FERC RTO.
The well-designed RTO - Using specific analogies we will outline how other similar interstate issues work (the short-term and long-term issues to planning); reasons to avoid balkanization; and we will identify the key elements of a well-designed RTO.
Governance Issues - Here we will address the issue of independent boards not beholden to commission interests; we'll show how the state isn't really losing control that in fact there will be a diminished role for commissions and legislators; we'll attempt to distinguish between regional led organizations v institutional (using water issues/planning in the Northwest as an example; We'll draw from history and look at NE and PJM and how organizations like NECPUC were formed. 
Environmental Issues - We're first going to develop an outline to see whether a document is necessary.  But some of the issues to be addressed are air quality benefits and NIMBY issues.

Understand that the above is a simplified and very narrow list of issues.  It is not an exhaustive list of what we need to address - it's only a start based on your comments.  
 
I will coordinate with TC and FE on timeframe for delivery, but I am expecting a draft set of documents by September 7th.  
I will identify approximately 5 people from our RTO Team to review the draft documents and weigh in with comments. 
I will provide everyone with a set of final documents by mid-September.
 
***************************************************
AS PART OF OUR RTO ADVOCACY EFFORT, I WILL BE ASSIGNING WEEKLY DELIVERABLES TO PEOPLE.  PLEASE KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THESE EMAILS - THEY WILL USUALLY BE SENT OUT ON FRIDAY MORNINGS AND DUE THE FOLLOWING MONDAY.  
 
Since Monday is Labor Day I am assigning this week's deliverable today and it will be due by Tuesday, September 4th.
 
Deliverable
Please provide me with a complete list of upcoming meetings you have scheduled where the RTO issue will be discussed.  Specifically, I am looking for the date and who the meeting is with.  This deliverable includes presentations you are making at conferences and the like.

Jeff,
?
I will not be in the office tomorrow - off to  Sacramento to see NCPA - but I 
wanted to provide my comments regarding the  Sempra presentation.? First of 
all, you did a great job.??I don't  know about ""Partnership Solutions""; 
however, I can't think of a better  description of what we want so, let's 
make it work.
?
Here are my comments:
?
1.? On the page, ""Partnership Goals"", under  2nd bullet.
?
??? Change ""Enhance earnings"" to  ""Enhance earnings; Expand P/E Multiple""
?
2.? On the page, ""Energy Solutions"", remove  both 25 MW quotes.? They don't 
have much meaning to Sempra; therefore, I  suggest we go with the two 500 MW 
quotes only.
?
3.? On the page, ""Energy Solutions"", under the  2nd bullet.
?
??? Change ""Sempra gets better....""  to 
?
??? ""Enhanced access to  markets""
??? ""Open, liquid and  competitive""
??? ""Defensible to oversight  entities""
?
4.? On the page, ""Benefits of Online  Independent Auction"", the 3rd and 4th 
bullets?are not?benefits of the  auction.? They are benefits of?a fixed price 
product. Do we need a  bullet to suggest that Sempra needs a portfolio 
approach which includes some  fixed priced products?
?
5.? On the page, ""Enron Can Help"", under the  4th bullet, change Lot 
formulation to Product Specifications.? After  Pre-Qualification:? 
Experience,?Capability, Credit-worthiness,  Reliability
?
6.? On the page, ""Gas Solution, Procurement  Outsourcing 1"", under the 1st 
bullet, indicate multi-year instead of 10  year.
?
7.? On the page, ""Gas Solution, Procurement  Outsourcing 2"", in the 2nd 
bullet, pluralize service to services.
?
8.? On the page, ""Benefits of Procurement  Outsourcing"", under the 1st bullet 
in the 3rd point (responsive to financial  community) - Add to the existing 
statement, Reduce?regulatory risk tied to  procurement, ""Enhance Earnings, 
Expand P/E Multiple"".
?
Thanks for your efforts in developing this.?  I'll be in late Monday and 
Tuesday morning.
?

1326,"Hi Don,
Hope you were not effected by Allison this past weekend.  I was almost caught in it on Friday.  Kirit Purbhoo and I were up there with your guys and luckily we left in time.  Just as soon as we got off 45 (going North), they started to shut it down.  Anyway, it was still a close call. 

 I just wanted to drop you a note to let you know how thankful I am to you and the guys (Joe, Reese & Steve).  By the way , Joe Errigo has given me permission to use him for reference.  It was a great opportunity to get some hands on training.  I really enjoyed the fast paced environment.  Now more than ever I am convinced that this is exactly what I want to do.  The opportunities which are available in your area (shift work and learning to trade and move power) is  very appealing to me and  I am eager to start.  Where I lack in experience, I more than make up for with ambition and dedication.  I can sincerely say that I will do whatever it takes to learn the position and learn it well.  I anxiously wait for an opportunity to interview with you and other managers on the 24 hour desk.   Hoping to hear from you soon.  

Sincerely,

Zarin Imam

available for you on arrival. The paper includes the following:
Itinerary
Conference details
Brattle paper summary
Media interview background
General key messages
Electricity wholesaling reactive statement
Political update
Meeting briefing notes




You will note one further change to the itinerary. We will be meeting with 
METI rather than the Fair Trade Commission. The purpose of the METI meeting 
will be to explain our concerns with the current regulatory environment and 
Enron Japan's proposal to temporarily suspend its electricity wholesaling 
activities. We met with our METI working level contacts today to brief them 
on Brattle and in particular the shortcomings of the current system. We did 
not discuss suspension of our wholesaling activities. The meeting briefing 
notes will be available on your arrival in Tokyo.


I also attach the latest version of the Brattle paper and, for completeness, 
the final version of the presentation and notes. 




I will call you at the Palace Hotel on Monday at 6pm. If you have any hiccups 
with arrangements please let me know. My contact numbers are as follows:

Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

Credit Suisse First Boston filed at FERC for power marketer authorization on July 23, 2001.  On September 18, 2001 FERC granted the authorization, effective 9/18/01 (57 days).

I am having trouble finding Bank of America's filing, so will let you know.

Subject: Revised draft attributes paper



Please see attached.

We have tried to develop five basic market objectives, show why these
critical given Enron's strategic position, and describe some of the market
attributes that follow from the positions. I think these attributes will
lead directly to (at least our) proposed ""ideal"" RTO structure.

We can cut down some of the background discussion if you wish to circulate
it to any other audiences within the company. But I wanted you guys to have
a sense of where we are coming from with respect to some of the conclusions.

Unless instructed otherwise I will continue to circulate documents only to
the two of you, and you can forward to others as you see fit.

1340,"FYI:  Pipeline name change.  Not sure who this might impact.  At least I don't see any deals in Sitara on this pipeline.

There will be a quiz tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 PM.

Subject:	Pipeline Name Change, effects Global Facility & Global Contracts

Okay, not sure who, if anyone, cares or needs to know BUT . . . . 

Stingray Pipeline Company (34271) has been changed to Stingray Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (200104). This change created a new Global Counterparty number so it prompted manual changes to the Pipeline Name & Pipeline Counterparty data within Global Facilities. It also prompted the need to move (via assignment within Global Contracts) all service related agreements from the old GCP record to the new GCP record. I left both names on the Global Record, BUT due to system controls can only have 1 listed with the role of ""Pipeline"". This role was assigned to the ""new"" name & the old name (which is now a suspended GCP record) was made ""Alternate Payee"". This was a ""guess"" role - - - - and I have no idea of how the service side is impacted or at what level it validates the Global record attached to the deal. All contract services are the same on each record, but the role of ""Pipeline"" now resides with the new GCP.

Can you either let all those who need to know - - - know & let me know who/how should I share information like this in the future. You got a Transportation Greenie (just 'learned' how to change pipeline names today) over here.

Thanks so much!!

I believe all of you received a request from Jeremy Blachman to hold the 
afternoon of January 10th open for an off-site to discuss the manner in which 
RAC and Research assess/test the credit quality of EES transactions.   I 
realize that RAC and EES have had many discussions as to the methodology, but 
it might be helpful for all of us to understand the actual derivation of some 
of analysis.    Please call me with any questions or comments at ext # 30349.

The agenda will be as follows:

12:00 - 1:00 Lunch
1:00 - 3:30   Presentations
3:30 - to close  Discussion

RAC/Research Presentations

The following topics would be of interest to EES:

1 -  The derivation of default probabilities including  (Research)
 - - a discussion of the actual mathematical process,
 - - the analytics behind why these computations are deemed the best for 
Enron,
 - - a comparison to historic default rates and why they differ (in respect 
to actual default rates, shape of the cumulative default curves etc.

2 -  The volatilities which are used to determine possible loss scenarios for 
the commodity portion of EES deals including (Research)
 - - the selection of curves
 - - the application of those curves to the actual credit reserve model and
 - - why these particular tests are applicable to our products.

3  -  The recovery rates used in the credit reserve model.   How are these 
figures derived? (RAC)

4  -  How RAC and Research have adjusted the credit reserve model to 
accommodate unusual aspects of the deal including  (RAC)
 - - promotion payments,
 - - accounts receivable
 - - committed capital
 - - and other factors



EES also understands that some of you may be familiar with our processes, 
however, there are perhaps areas that you would like to understand more 
fully.   Please tell us what you would like to hear from us.

Also, RAC has sent us the credit reserve model and I have seen completed 
models.   Perhaps prior to our meeting on Wednesday,  someone from RAC and/or 
Research could sit with me and someone from Phil Layton's group and go 
through the process of how the various pieces are put together.

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

1347,"Vince,
 We wanted to thank you for your time and support today.  We have been 
thinking about our conversation and it may be better to wait until December 
before you approached Delainey.  This time period would give us the 
opportunity to change his impression of our contributions to gas and power.  
Please let us know if you would advise differently.


Thank you,

Kristin and John

Good Morning....

As a placeholder, Narsimha previously suggested $0.25/MWH for the scheduling fee component of the fixed ""Management Fee"".  Do you think this is still a reasonable number to use?  If so, we would use it in our notional estimates, and Deal Management would use the same value for executable pricing.   

Thanks!

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

When you buy from the imbalance(Services 2mw for HE 17-22) please make sure that you buy from the correct zone(i.e.  if finals have sp load dec'd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp).  Day shift, assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for 3 hours they dec'd SP load.  Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED,  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a -2 for HE 17-22.  As always we don't want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want.

2.  Unless I have been informed incorrectly, we should be accounting for bloomberg fees as a fee rather than sticking it the price.  This should make the SAR and settlements just a little easier.

1355,"I would be very willing to make a presentation to you.  This coming Thursday 
unfortunately, I have a sick day scheduled (babies will do this kind of thing 
to you) and will not come into the office.

Would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a 
few (possibly) interested individuals?  This might give us more shceduling 
flexibility and would also seem more appropriate, knowing that what I have is 
a set of suggestions for development and no earth-shuttering, live product.

Yannis,

 Shirley will know the room in which the lunch is scheduled. Let her know 
what audio-visual materials you'll need. Keep in mind that the research group 
is now about 40 people, some of whom will be watching the presentation on 
video from Portland and from London. The best platform would be to get a 
PC-video or PC-screen link-up, so that everyone, including people watching 
remotely, can see your computer's monitor on a big screen.

 The itinerary for the lunch is that we meet at 11:30 and eat lunch and trade 
news for the first 30-45 minutes, and then at 12:00 or 12:30 at the latest, 
we have a presentation. We try to wrap up by 1:00, so that what we discussed 
yesterday should make for a very good presentation in pretty much every way. 
>From my experience, the audio-visual people need at least an hour advance 
warning to get the screens linked up. Let me know if you need any help in 
getting you and Jenny the things you need.

DJ Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal<ENE.N><MSFT.O>
   By Michael Rieke
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

    HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling
was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for
his company's foundering broadband business.

    Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth
for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron
would give more details on the deal later.

    After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence
by suing Microsoft.

    In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron
claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal.

    The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide
network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed
Internet service, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for
use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the
deal, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal,
so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal,
the lawsuit said.

Paid by Local Telephone ...



FCC May Phase Out Phone Fees Paid by Local Telephone Companies 
  
12/04/2000 
Dow Jones Business News 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -- In a boost for the Baby Bells, the head of the Federal 
Communications Commission said he hopes his agency soon will approve a plan 
to gradually eliminate the billions of dollars of fees local telephone 
companies pay each other to complete calls, The Wall Street Journal reported 
on Monday. 
FCC Chairman William Kennard is circulating among the other four 
commissioners a plan to phase out the fees over three years. He said details 
are being negotiated, but the plan would set a formula to determine if call 
traffic -- and therefore the fees -- is going disproportionately from some 
local phone companies to others, in particular those carrying many calls to 
an Internet services provider. 
The phaseout plan would cap temporarily the number of calls one phone company 
must pay when another completes calls from the first company's customers, the 
Journal reported. After the phaseout period, the fees would be eliminated. 
Companies competing with the Bells that carry a lot of traffic to Internet 
services providers include Pac-West Telecomm Inc., Stockton, Calif., and 
Focal Communications Corp., of Chicago. 
Baby Bells would prefer an immediate elimination of the fees, since the Bells 
pay a disproportionate amount of them, but officials say they could live with 
the fees being phased out. 
Mr. Kennard told the Journal that the plan to eliminate the fees was prompted 
by the explosion of competitive local phone companies living off the fees by 
carrying calls to Internet services providers. States would be given 
flexibility in adopting the fee elimination, if the FCC approves it, he said. 
They wouldn't be obligated to accept it if they already had a fee system that 
worked well. 
Originally, the fees, known as reciprocal compensation, were adopted at the 
behest of the Bells and other incumbents. They were supposed to benefit the 
incumbent phone companies, because customers of competing local phone 
companies were calling their customers and therefore increasing the traffic 
on the incumbent's phone network, the Journal reported. 
But then competing phone companies were set up, and their business included 
serving Internet services providers, which accept calls but don't make them. 
Under the fee system, that one-way traffic tends to work against the Baby 
Bells. The competing companies have said that if the fees were cut, it would 
cause a hike in Internet access costs, because they would have to charge more 
to carry the calls. 
Mr. Kennard said he hopes for a decision on the plan before year end.

Hey you guys,

We are trying to implement a 'VaR transaction' policy - and would like your 
opinion.

This is going to be tough - because I'm not sure we have implemented a 
similiar policy across any of our other 'books' - that is - we looking to 
bring in all the accrual/operational assets as well as the MTM stuff 
(lambdas). To have a real-live 'configuration' of the system.

If assets/routes/servers etc...are added - what is the impact on the 'value' 
of the system and what it's worth. 

John has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts.

I can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know 
the VaR of your whole trading portfolio. However - I've not seen this done 
with a mixture of MTM & accrual assets. Add the spice of a 'operational 
system' valuation  - and this will be tough to quantify and model.

Step 1 - configure system and value it 
Step 2 - calculate a VaR on this. We will need to do some work here!
Step 3 - calculate the incremental VaR of new deals/amendements/reconfigs etc 
- tough....

See what you think?

B.

some early thinking going on limits for the V@R.  For example, should we 
effectively shut down all server relocations without approval,  or allow some 
level of MB of storage to be moved around or reconfigured?

I need some commercial and industry realism for this.  We may need Rick 
Paiste or your industry helpers (Marquardt, etc. to help us).

Barry,  Lou,  I need your input.

1376,"Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After 
our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last 
draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
""market-based.""   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a 
built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated 
into a separate option fee.  

The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and 
the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use 
transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they 
buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a 
service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If 
you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know.

I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some 
examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from 
a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options 
will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll 
circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas 
or questions.

As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing 
in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable 
meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some 
concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final 
tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss 
their questions?  Let me know what you think.

Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting 
first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.

Thanks again for taking the time to meet.  We're very interested in
following up on the demand buy-down/energy efficiency issues and are glad
to assist if we can--and we think we can.

As I mentioned, I've attached the final version of the document we've been
distributing in Sacramento describing our proposed solution to California's
energy crisis. If you have any questions about it, or want to discuss it
further, just let me know.

Also attached is the letter we sent to the PUC supporting Comm'r Bilas'
alternative decision designed to 1) make CDWR a creditworthy entity and 2)
permit the Legislature to continue its work on a ""Direct Access"" fix
without interference from the PUC. It's critical that the PUC adopt the
Bilas decision as soon as possible.

In addition, I'm including a story regarding the EOB/ISO filing at FERC
alleging price gouging and demanding refunds.  As we discussed, it's
creating a good deal of consternation in the market.

Finally, we'd be very interested meeting with you and the folks from
McKinsey on our reverse-auction for demand reductions.

Have a nice weekend.  Look forward to talking again very soon.

Best,
Jeff

POWER POINTS: How To Raise Electricity Prices, ISO-Style
   By Mark Golden
   A Dow Jones Newswires Column

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--There they go again. The California Independent
System Operator has initiated another attempt to suppress wholesale
electricity
prices rather than deal with the fundamental reasons of why prices are
high.
  Like past anti-market moves, Thursday's request that the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission slash suppliers' unpaid invoices for December and
January power will fail in its stated aim. Also as with past attempts, the
ISO's
action this week will likely result in higher costs for Edison
International (EIX)
unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric,
Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and the state's
Department of
Water Resources.
  The ISO, which is responsible for maintaining the balance of power supply
and demand on most of the state's power grid, has suffered the unintended
consequences of its actions many times before. When the ISO passed a
$250/MWh price cap in the summer, the cap became a target and caused prices
to rise,
just as the ISO had been warned it would. When the ISO exercised its
ability to
buy power above its cap only from out-of-state utilities, California
generators
sold power to the out-of-state utilities, which in turn sold the power back
to
California at a markup.
  The latest attempt to suppress the market is mind-numbingly stupid. The
ISO wants the FERC to order retroactive discounts for power it says was
sold at
unreasonably high prices. Merchant generators, other western utilities and
power marketers sold about $3 billion worth of bulk power to the ISO in
December
and January. The ISO says overcharging accounts for $560 million of that
total.
Suppliers' prices, which the ISO agreed to pay at the time, exceeded
hypothetical generating costs by more than 10% and are therefore
unreasonable,the grid manager says.
  Actual refunds might greatly exceed $560 million, according to the ISO,
once the FERC looks at the suppliers' actual costs. Power from a generating
company that bought natural gas before the spot market ran up, for example,
should
be discounted the most. Generators that waited and paid the most for gas
would
make the bigger profit per megawatt hour. What a great idea: punish the
smart and
reward the stupid.
  Staffers lead by Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis,
and Eric Hildebrandt, manager of market monitoring, spent a fair amount of
time
and money to establish this shocker: In a supply-short commodity market,
prices
exceed producers' costs.
  Where they vary from well-established economic principles is that they
find this ""unreasonable.""
  Sheffrin and Hildebrandt want the FERC to obtain extensive cost data from
all suppliers - including government-owned utilities Los Angeles Department
of
Water & Power and Canada's BC Hydro - and begin hearings on refunds. This
would
cover the vast majority of sales to the ISO during December and January
because
almost every seller to the ISO exceeded the $150 per megawatt-hour ""soft""
price
cap, above which transactions must be reported to the FERC for possible
review.
  There is no question the ISO has been paying prices that exceed even the
already high market prices. On Tuesday, for example, the ISO paid an
average
price of $337/MWh for power that other western utilities had bought and
sold
for $175-$200/MWh. On that one day, the ISO paid almost $25 million for
power
that was worth about $14 million.
  The reason: The ISO has had to pay a premium to the rest of the market
since the middle of December, when suppliers correctly figured out that the
utilities were running out of cash and wouldn't be able to pay their ISO
bills. Once
northwestern utilities stopped selling to the ISO at any price, the ISO
asked some of the in-state generating companies like Williams Cos. (WMB) to
step
into the middle on its behalf. Williams did so for what it has called a
reasonable profit.
  Let's say that Williams bought from some other generator at $450/MWh and
sold to the ISO at $500/MWh. That would be reasonable based on Williams'
costs,
according to the ISO's view.
  But if the generator sold directly to the ISO in the first place at
$450/MWh,it would be ordered to provide a refund, because its generating
costs are
assuredly nowhere near $450/MWh.
  So, according to the ISO, $500/MWh is reasonable, but $450/MWh is too
high.
  If the FERC were to order refunds as the ISO has requested, no company
that generates power would ever again sell to the ISO. It would always sell
to
some third party, which in turn would sell the electricity to the ISO at a
markup.
  Does the ISO ever stop and think through the impact of what it tries to
do?
  ""We certainly recognize that's a problem, and it's something FERC needs
to
grapple with,"" Hildebrandt said in an interview.
  What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself. ""We reject proposals
to
return to cost-based regulation,"" the FERC said in its Dec. 15 California
ruling.
  The FERC will review some of the high prices, as required. But refunds
will be ordered only if the FERC finds that a particular seller to
California - or a
colluding group of sellers - withheld supplies in order to increase prices,
according to the FERC ruling.
  But collusion won't likely be found. There have been many investigations
into whether sellers have created a ""false scarcity."" None have found it.
  In December, Republican FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, now chairman,
applauded the commission's decision to ""reserve 'price mitigation' for real
exercises
of market power rather than focusing on the price level itself.""
  The issue of the ISO and utilities having to pay a credit-risk premium
arose after the FERC had decided what it would do about California. But,
according
to a source knowledgeable about FERC operations under Hebert's leadership,
the
commission will recognize the credit-risk premium as reasonable.
  In the meantime, however, the specter of retroactive price controls and
the increased hassle of dealing with the ISO makes suppliers even more
reluctant
to sell to the ISO. The ISO will have to overcome that reluctance by
offering
to pay an even higher premium.
  Good move.

1393,"Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity 
legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other 
interested parties including industry segments, public power and state 
regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve 
Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an 
agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an 
electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package 
that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next 
week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the 
discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine 
whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee 
leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in 
the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported 
legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained 
over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts 
progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language 
that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and 
federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action 
in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together 
a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the 
understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to 
our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal 
siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant 
interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to 
link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection 
and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the 
details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the 
minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks 
floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have 
made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market 
rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up 
occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and 
other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will 
take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will 
have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and 
reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is 
released.

Subject:	ENRON - A Study in How So Few Could Screw So Many

Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disgusted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrence. 

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nosed, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and held on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometimes daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top executives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlements, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in the Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in February how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the cynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was hopeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e., +/- 20%.  

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afraid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have many working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my savings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your cohorts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending your millions.....

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  ""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind,"" he said. ""The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators.""

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a ""blind pig could
make money"" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  ""It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it,"" Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP ""an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers.""

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Shelley Norman

1401,"Enron has made initial payments toward the purchase of Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs) for Houston Texans Football, and has the right to purchase the associated season tickets.  Enron is no longer interested in these season tickets and is working to secure the best economic result for the estate.  This may involve stopping any further payments, however if there is significant interest among employees in buying the season tickets from Enron, the company may pursue a resale arrangement as one means of recovering the investment it has already made.

If you're interested in purchasing any of Enron's PSLs and season tickets for the Texans, please respond by 4PM, Central Time on Wednesday, June 12 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you would be interested in purchasing and the price category.  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined from the employee group, Enron will determine how to proceed in order to benefit the estate.   As listed below, the face value of the PSLs range from $1,900 to $3,900 each, and the face value of the season tickets range from $645 to $2575 each.   It is currently envisioned that if any sale of the interests by Enron does occur, it would be open to the public as well as employees.

Please note that your response will not obligate either you or Enron in any way.  Responses will be considered an expression of interest only, and do not guarantee if, when, or at what price respondents may be able to purchase these assets.

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

1413,"I made a few changes from on the Socal forecast:

1.)  Put in the updated PV, NP, & SP power curves - now the generators are 
running at peak levels
2.) Increased Ehrenberg from 1.2 to 1.25
3.) Took off the weather adjustments when the new SP generation begins

The new forecast brings Socal storage to a max of 86 Bcf before Q3.  We can 
discuss this further on Monday.

Matt,
To refresh your memory from Friday night, I got laid off and am doing independent work right now.  Although the money is good, the stability is a factor. So, if there is anyone you might know at Enron to help me get an interview for that associate program, I would appreciate it.  My resume is attached.  Thanks for helping me out.  Take care.

1421,"Lisa,

I have a call into the physical steel lawyer.  We will not be able to copy an 
existing profile for physical steel.  Physical steel is a totally new online 
product for us.  We, obviously, cannot copy financial steel, because 
counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not ESP's, if 
their master doesn't let them trade steel, etc (the usual swap issues).  What 
I think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why any 
counterparty cannot trade physical steel, so I would open all counterparties 
up to trade it.  I'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm this.

Just a note, Global Contracts should also not be able to copy a profile, 
because they should have a totally new GTC dealing with physical steel issues 
specifically.  I'm sure Karen will probably copy me in on her email.  Just in 
case...I want to confirm what Global Contracts is saying for this one...

I'll get back to you to confirm the above for Legal.

mind, exemplifies and embodies the best of  Enron's vision and values: She 
works hard, produces outstanding results for the group, posesses an attitude 
that is optimistic and fun-loving, and still does an extraordinary job of 
balancing the personal and professional. Ginger, to put it succinctly, is a 
treasure and I am very pleased and proud to recognize her accomplishments.

FERC COMMISSIONER HEBERT ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY
POLICY ISSUES AT HOUSTON LUNCHEON

PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES                                   October 27, 2000

SUBJECT: Electric Utilities

----- ANALYST(S) --------------------          -------- OPINION --------
M. Carol Coale   713.650-4732                 Current:Accumulate
David R. Tameron 713.650-4731                 Risk:--



----- HIGHLIGHTS---------------------------------------------------------
1)   On October 26, FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert spoke on ""Competition &
America's Energy Policy"" to group of Houston industry executives, addressing 
the
merits and problems with electricity deregulation.
2)   Commissioner Hebert, the sole Republican, supports a comprehensive energy
policy, renewable fuel use, improved pipeline certification, and flexibility,
but opposes price controls and free market intervention.
3)   Last week, the California ISO called on the FERC to rule on a ""market
stabilization plan"" that would affectively cap the price electricity at 
$100/mWh
unless 70% of the power generated is sold forward within the state.
4)   FERC is expected to address this issue on 11/1, but we do not expect much
involvement until after the presidential elections, particularly given that 
the
FERC Commissioners are Presidential appointees.
5)   While we believe FERC's role in the electricity market problems in
California will be limited, any action taken is likely to be ""bold, ambitious
and strict"", requiring results, but likely would not affect 2001.

----- DISCUSSION---------------------------------------------------------
Energy is one of the leading topics in the approaching general elections and
congressional races, and spiking energy prices have been an area of 
contention.
Regional shortages have resulted in spikes in the price of electricity, and
this past summer, hot weather in the western U.S. sent electricity prices
soaring.  In California, where the rate payers served by PG&E and Edison
International are protected under a rate freeze, the higher power costs cannot
be passed on by the electric utilities to the consumer.  In southern 
California,
the situation is just the opposite.  Having recovered its stranded investment
costs from its ratepayers, Semipro Energy is charging market rates to 
consumers
which are complaining of higher electric bills.  While the government has
intervened by approving price caps on ancillary electric service in the state
and has capped the electric bills of low-income consumers in San Diego, the
state regulators are calling for more government involvement.

In California several proposals are on the table:
1)   A consumer group has called for the ""excessive"" profits earned by
generators and marketers this past summer to be retroactively refunded to
ratepayers.  .
2)   U.S. Rep. Bob Finer, D-California, introduced a bill to the House that
would create disincentives for power companies to earn profits, imposing a
windfall profits tax on wholesale power sold in the western U.S.
3)   As recently as last night, October 26, the California Independent System
Operator (ISO) implemented an interim measure that imposes hourly price caps 
on
generators based on forecasted load and arbitrary heat rates ranging between
negative $100/MWh and positive $250/MWh.  Effective on 11/3, the proposal
essentially shuts down the peaking generation plants which would not be able 
to
economically produce power within the state.
4)   California ISO staff has also proposed to impose a ""bid"" cap on 
electricity
of $100/mWh on power generators and marketers in the state that do not comply
with the requirement of selling 70% of their load under forward contracts 
within
the state of California.  Compliance with this Market Stabilization Plan means
that spot power will be sold under the existing $250/mWh price cap but 
violators
would be subjected to the $100 bid cap.
5)   California plans to require interruptible users of power to extend their
contracts, preventing these end users from switching to firm contracts, thus
ensuring that certain customers can be shut off in the event of a power
shortage.

While we doubt that any of these proposals will be passed in their current 
form,
the government is likely to be involved.  The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) has been overseeing the deregulation of the wholesale energy
markets, and has approved price caps in all of the regions that have opened to
competition thus far except for in the Midwest.  As a reminder, the FERC is 
made
up of commissioners that are appointed by the reigning President, and 
currently
the FERC is made up of three Democrats and one Republican (the other 
Republican
commissioner resigned earlier this year).

On Thursday, October 26, 2000, the sole Republican, Commissioner Curt Hebert,
Jr., gave a presentation to members of the Greater Houston Partnership on the
subject of ""Competition and America's Energy Policy"".  While his opinions are
not necessarily representative of the FERC as a whole, Hebert clearly supports
regulatory flexibility and free markets but is also sensitive to environmental
issues.  He is also vehemently opposed to price controls such as electricity
price caps in New England, New York and California.  Hebert believes that the
recent electricity price spikes in the West this past summer were great market
indicators that electric generation is in short supply, particularly during
periods of hot weather.  In the summer of 1999, the Midwest experienced 
similar
price spikes also related to summer heat.  The difference between the two
situations is that the Midwest allowed the market to decide, which responded
with new generation projects, but California imposed price controls on
electricity that have had the affect of discouraging new generation.  Thus, 
the
short supply situation in California may just get worse.

The FERC has completed an investigation of the recent electricity price spikes
in California but does not intend to release its findings to the general 
public.
  While we believe that the FERC will find a way to help resolve the situation
in that state, any actions would not likely take affect until 2002.  In the
interim, the electric utilities are suffering under a growing burden of
uncollected power purchase costs and are calling on the state regulators to
provide emergency financial relief.  Proposals include a refundable rate
surplus, removal of frozen rates, and/or the deferral of stranded cost 
recovery.
  We are doubtful that the FERC will rule on any action prior to the elections
because political considerations may influence their decisions.

Commissioner Hebert indicated that this was an opportunity for the FERC to 
send
to the electricity industry a signal on what may make the markets work, and
believe that any plan should be ""bold, ambitious and strict"" in requiring
results.  Renewable fuels are also likely to be encouraged, although this is 
not
necessarily good news for the natural gas industry, and old issues like the
Fuel Use Act and the ""Btu"" tax may resurface.  Ideally, the FERC would endorse
market pricing and encourage the development of electricity generation and
transmission infrastructure.  However, by doing so, the FERC may be perceived 
as
the ""bad guy"", which may not be ideal image in an election year.  However,
Hebert is hopeful that the FERC will move beyond politics and make the right
regulatory decision for the long term.  The benefits of price controls are 
short
term, and those markets under price caps may be disadvantages as the rest of
the U.S. opens to electric competition.

RE:       	NYBOT Decision to concentrate relocation efforts on One
North End Avenue


The New York Board of Trade has notified its members that last night its
board voted unanimously to drop its pursuit of all other relocation
alternatives and to concentrate all its efforts on coming to a final lease
agreement with our exchange on becoming a tenant at One North End Avenue.
	According to the letter, the main issue that still must be addressed
is NYBOT's ability to obtain a firm commitment for sufficient government aid
to fund the installation of needed technology on the COMEX Division floor.
They believe that solidifying the aid, and drafting the formal lease, could
take one to three months. Their preliminary target for completion of the
necessary work and NYBOT's commencing trading on the COMEX Division floor is
the first quarter of 2003.
	The main terms are for NYBOT to use 13,000 to13,500 square feet of
the COMEX Division trading floor and to lease about 35,000 square feet of
office space in the building. The basic lease is for 10 years, with the
potential for one, and possibly two, five-year extensions.

We welcome this decision by the board of the New York Board of Trade and
applaud their commitment to preserving the role of Lower Manhattan as the
financial capital of the world.  We believe this move will be beneficial to
the members and member firms of both institutions from the standpoint of
creating both efficiencies and additional opportunities.

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm

1438,"Gerald, I have attached a term sheet that I would like you to review.

As I mentioned we need to determine which contract we will use for these deals, (dedicated reserves or enfolio).  
In addition, we need to send renegotiation letters to several of the parties.  If you need the list Theresa can provide it.

Let me know your thoughts as soon as you can.

Real Time deals typically don't get confirmed; however, Chris Foster's generation customers have requested that we confirm their deals, whether day-ahead or hour-ahead.

For us, this means we need to pay special attention to the box marked ""Confirmation"" when entering deals. I know you're all in the habit of marking ""No"" under this designation, so review the following counterparty names carefully and commit them to memory, because deals with these generators NEED TO BE CONFIRMED. 

	Harbor Cogeneration
	Delano Energy
	Atlantic Richfield Co.
	Sierra Forest Products
	Wheelabrator Martell
	Wheelabrator Shasta
	Sierra Pacific Holding Co.
	Gas Recovery Systems
	East Bay MUD

Attached is a list of these counterparty names and corresponding contact information. Feel free to print this out and keep it in a nearby notebook.

Please let Chris or me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Demand Side,s Promise
?
The coldest days of the year are when wholesale electricity prices are  among 
their highest, and when the risks of blackouts are greatest, least  welcome, 
and even dangerous. On these days, frequently around the holidays, our  
electric system and wallets are stressed to the limit. As energy demand 
surges,  prices in the wholesale electric market skyrocket, with price caps 
serving as  the only limits to the pricing power of wholesale suppliers. And 
as more  electricity is generated, old fossil fuel power plants emit more and 
more  pollution into our environment.
?
At the other extreme, the hottest days of the year present the same  
scenario, often with the added designation of being the smoggiest days.  
Sometimes the smog * caused in part by the sun heating up pollutants emitted  
from power plants * is so bad that people are advised to stay indoors, and  
thousands with respiratory illness crowd emergency rooms across the nation.  
?
Yet, we could all breathe easier, save money, and worry less about our  power 
going out, if many more consumers were given the opportunity to change  their 
electric usage in response to escalating prices, and to profit from doing  
so. In electric restructuring vocabulary, &demand-side response8 is 
typically  used to describe these consumer actions to reduce or shift their 
electric usage  in response to changes in prices. 
?
For years, encouraging demand reduction or energy efficiency has been the  
holy grail for the environmental community, because many of our country,s 
most  pressing environmental and public health problems cannot be solved if 
the nation  simply guzzles ever more dirty power. But these days, the case 
for fostering  demand-side response has never been stronger, and there is an 
emerging consensus  that goes well beyond the environmental community about 
the importance of  increasing demand-side response. 
?
More and more experts now agree that empowering consumers to modify their  
electricity usage in response to price will powerfully address the triple 
threat  of pollution, high electric bills, and rolling blackouts, all of 
which are now  plaguing California. Indeed, electric restructuring in 
California or any other  state will not be complete until consumers are able 
to modify their usage in  response to real-time prices. 
?
But while greater demand-side response would deliver numerous benefits to  
consumers, the economy, system reliability, and the environment, most 
electric  markets presently provide far too few opportunities * even within 
Pennsylvania  and PJM, where retail and wholesale electricity competition 
have been the most  successful. 
?
Therefore, as the next crucial stage in its electricity restructuring,  
Pennsylvania and PJM must now lead the way in creating policies and market  
mechanisms to increase opportunities for demand-side response. 
Encouragingly,  both the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), where 
Commissioner  Fitzpatrick sponsored a November 21st conference on the 
subject, and PJM,s  management understand the stakes.
?
Demand-Side Benefits
A legitimate demand-side market  would serve as a check on high prices in the 
hourly and forward PJM energy  markets. PJM,s Market Monitoring Unit 
calculates that a 1 percent reduction in  demand during peak periods (about 
500 mW) can reduce market prices by about 10  percent. Empowering customers 
to participate in the demand-side market limits  wholesale and retail prices, 
impacting the forward market and making the retail  market more competitive. 
?
In addition, a demand-side response reduction of 5,000 mW would enable PJM  
to once again retain its one-day-in-ten reliability standard, an historic  
reliability benchmark which has been put at risk due to the off-system sales 
of  generators this past summer. 
?
The Technology
Three types of technologies are required  to achieve 5,000 mW of reliable 
demand-side participation. Each is readily  available and, more importantly, 
pays for itself. Yet not enough of these  technologies are being installed in 
homes and businesses to safeguard the public  interest.
?
Remote appliance controls. These controls enable a consumer to  voluntarily 
curtail his/her electric usage during peak periods in exchange for  an 
economic benefit. For example, in its &On Call8 program, FPL installs an  
energy management device in consumers, homes, connecting it to one or more  
qualifying appliances. Through this program, FPL pays consumers up to $161 
per  year in credits on their electric bills. More than 600,000 FPL customers 
are  currently participating. 
?
Here in PJM, BGE pays residential consumers $10 per summer month for  
installing an &Energy Saver Switch8 on their central air conditioners. 
During  periods of high demand for electricity, BGE sends a radio signal 
which activates  the switch, cycling the compressor in 15-minute increments. 
More than 225,000  BGE residential customers currently use the Energy Saver 
Switch and help BGE  manage summer peak load. Consumers who choose to 
similarly cycle their electric  water heater receive an additional $5 credit 
per summer month. 
?
Also in PJM, PEPCO,s 200 mW-sized &kilo-watchers plus8 program offers  
participants about $100/year for the right to remotely cycle 100 hours of  
residential air conditioning. In another example, The Allegheny Electric  
Cooperative in Pennsylvania remotely switches air conditioners and water 
heaters  from a central location in downtown Harrisburg.
?
For most consumers in these programs, it,s money in the bank without  
noticeable impact. These programs demonstrate that many small consumers want 
the  opportunity to voluntary save money in return for agreeing to brief  
interruptions of selected appliances, and that it,s fairly simple to provide 
the  technology and operate the program.
?
The Pennsylvania PUC and other state Commissions should encourage and, if  
necessary, direct jurisdictional EDCs to offer remote appliance devices to  
consumers. It,s not difficult to imagine that, if remote appliance devices 
were  implemented throughout PJM, 3,000 mW of small commercial and 
residential  remotely cycled load could be bid in a demand-side market. 
?
Metering Set-Top Devices or Advanced Metering. Advanced metering or  metering 
set-top devices register load decrements, enabling consumers and/or  their 
suppliers to sell firm power into the peak market, instead of using it.  For 
example, a supplier (either the local utility or a competitive supplier)  
could offer a lower price to a large consumer willing to reduce usage during  
peak load, enabling the supplier to sell a relatively small amount of  
electricity to those requiring firm service during the peak load. The 
consumer  need not agree to limit usage except upon specific approval. 
Already Duquesne  and soon PECO Energy will have deployed advanced metering 
system-wide,  demonstrating that it can be economic even without the benefits 
of demand-side  response. 
?
There are also various devices or meter add-ons that modify existing meters  
and allow recording of load decrements (see, for example, 
www.stonewatersoftware.com). These  devices or meter add-ons appear to pay 
for themselves when the energy is sold  during periods when prices are above 
the price the consumer is paying the EDC.  
?
The need to ensure reliability in PJM, combined with the current  
availability of technology to enable demand-side participation by all 
consumers,  dictate that by 2004, all Pennsylvania customers should be 
equipped with a  metering or appliance control device.
?
Internet-based Energy Management Platforms. Computer software is  necessary 
to maximize the effectiveness of advanced metering. Programs have  already 
been developed and used by major international corporations which enable  
them to make precise decisions on when to sell power back into the market,  
decrease usage, and use on-site generation. BGE, for one, recently announced  
deployment of the Omni-Link platform 
(www.powerwebtechnologies.com/news/111200.htm).  
?
Demand-Side Barriers
There are no inherent obstacles to  obtaining the benefits of demand-side 
responses, but there are several important  commitments necessary to make the 
promise of demand-side market participation a  reality. 
?
PJM and other ISOs, as well as utilities and suppliers, must all be able to  
offer demand-side platforms without discrimination. In addition, PJM and 
other  ISOs have the direct responsibility to manage system reliability and 
the  wholesale energy market. Demand-side responses directly impact 
reliability and  wholesale market prices, including undesirable market power 
during peak load.  There can be no doubt that ISOs have an inherent role, 
indeed an inherent  responsibility, to maximize the effective deployment of 
demand-side market  responses, especially to offer a platform for LSEs to 
sell load decrements  created in response to price signals. PJM is on board, 
but consumers who want to  sell directly into the PJM demand-side market face 
opposition from some  EDCs.
?
To unlock the potential of demand-side markets, the Pennsylvania PUC, other  
state commissions and the FERC must support the role of PJM and other ISOs 
in  creating such a market. PJM must be permitted and encouraged to offer a  
demand-side platform. Finally, EDCs must be required to fully deploy 
advanced  metering and remote appliance control programs.
?
These small but important public policies will help to protect the  
reliability of our electricity system, our wallets, and our environment.

Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted

02/15/2002 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) 
HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. 
Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. 
Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. 
Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.

Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Wee! k ! Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Kens Killers Updated 10/22/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice ! th! is week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the St. Petersburg Times. ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 10/22/01 Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""  James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the Chicago Tribune reports that the Bears will continue to use an alternating syste! m ! with him and James Allen. ""We will continue to use them both,"" said offensive coordinator John Shoop. ""Anthony did a great job today, though."" As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season.   Fred Baxter , TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.  Robert Wilson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be evaluated on a daily basis.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception. Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated! 1! 0/22/01 Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards on Sunday.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/22/01 Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current! s! tatus is day to day.  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next week's game against Detroit.  J.R. Redmond , RB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Powers Rangers Updated 10/22/01 Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week;s game is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/22/01 Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the Baltimore Sun, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. !  Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength, but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on November 4.    Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/22/01 Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again until November 4.   Isaac Bruce , WR ST! L ! - Powers Rangers Updated 10/22/01 Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for Bruce to do better next week against the Saints.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/22/01 Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season. Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.  Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will be the primary receiver in his absence.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.  Ricky Williams , RB NO - Kens Killers Updated 10/22/01 Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21 carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the second half. ""We couldn't do anything in the second half,"" Williams said. ""We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made plays."" Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams this Sunday.    Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter for the rest of th! e ! season.   Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - Commissioner Updated 10/22/01 Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is out for the season.    Corey Bradford , WR GB - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

BPA and Kaiser Reach Agreement on Power (IB)
Kaiser Aluminum and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) reached an agreement on a five-year power delivery deal that has been the source of conflict between the two parties for almost a year. Kaiser Aluminum closed its smelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late 2000, choosing to resell contracted power from the BPA on the spot market. According to the Spokesman Review, ""Kaiser netted more than $460 million from the sales."" Other aluminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring 2001 with Bonneville. Under these agreements, the companies agreed to keep smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region, and BPA agreed, in return, to give the smelters, when they restarted operations, a $20 per megawatt-hour (MWh) credit for obtaining power from sources other than BPA. Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA that negates a ""take-or-pay"" clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the federal power whether used or not. BPA said, ""Under the agreement signed today, Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take all the power under the contract...And if [BPA] can't resell it, we are not going to hold [Kaiser] liable for the difference,"" Clearing Up reported. As a concession for the elimination of the ""take-or-pay"" clause, Kaiser will receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its 240 MW load. Kaiser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was using the money it had gained reselling power ""to pay down long-term debt, rebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuses,"" rather than splitting the money between workers that had been laid off, the BPA, and building generation, AP reported.

United States-Energy: 
CA Power Authority Names CEO (IB)
The California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority named Laura Doll its new chief executive officer on 5 October. Texan Doll ""had previously worked for several communications and consulting firms,"" and will be receiving a salary of $200,000 as the power authority's CEO, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. S. David Freeman, the authority's chair, will retain his post. Freeman said he will ""handle fewer administrative duties,"" and will ""be able to devote more time to reaching out to interest groups such as the Legislature and consumer groups,"" The Chronicle reported. According to a 7 October report in the Orange County Register, consumer groups, businesses, and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the power authority, which has vowed to secure nearly 3,000 megawatts (MW) of power by summer 2002 to avoid power shortages. The power authority, which was created by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May 2001, can issue up to $5 billion in bonds to bolster the state's power supply through financing new renewable generation or peaker projects. The Register said that businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates could be the result of the power authority initiative to bring 1,000 MW of green power and 2,000 MW of peaker generation on line by summer 2002. The state's Joint Legislative Audit Committee would look into the authority's planned purchases, according to the committee chair, Assembly member Fred Keeley. Keeley said ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law,"" the Register reported.

United States-Energy: 
FERC Refunds Ordered (IB)
On 5 October, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered four power marketers to provide refunds for July sales that exceeded a federally mandated price limit. Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos., and Reliant Energy were the companies specifically mentioned. Under a 19 June FERC order, price limits were established in 11 Western states to help tame the volatile electricity spot market. The June order stated that companies charging in excess of the mitigated price had seven days past the end of the month in question to file justifications for their overcharges. The 5 October order said that the aforementioned companies filed justifications, but all were rejected, and that other companies that overcharged during July, but did not file justifications, would also be subject to ordered refunds. Although FERC did not release specific figures, the California Independent System Operator said that total overcharges for the month amounted to $260,000, The Los Angeles Times reported. The commission's order explained the rejection of cost justifications for the four companies. The explanations by Mirant and Dynegy, filed more than seven days after July ended, were ""untimely and...neither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transactions,"" according to the document. Reliant's filing was ""not consistent with the requirements of the June 19 Order,"" and Willams ""did not provide any cost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the commission's pricing methodology,"" the commissioners wrote. A Mirant spokesman told Reuters that ""his company was ordered to refund $33,800,"" while a Williams spokesman told the LA Times ""$30,000 worth of electricity sales are subject to the FERC rebate for both June and July.""

Hey Joe-
I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).  Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.

		Welcome to our second installment of Insights@CERA, a  bi-monthly review of CERA research and analysis, upcoming events, new  services, and expert commentary.

		 Insights@CERA   Issue 2, January  2002    Featured This Month:  Upcoming Events    New Products and Services    New Research    Multimedia Highlights    CERA in the News     UPCOMING EVENTS  CERAWEEK 2002  ""The New Face of Risk: Energy  Strategies for a Changed World"", February 11-15, 2002 in Houston, Texas. -  The premier international gathering of senior energy decision makers. How  will global uncertainty impact strategic investment decisions? How will it  reshape infrastructure strategies and the relationship between the public  and private sectors? How should business respond to the changing nature of  risk and need? CERAWeek will offer a framework for understanding and  navigating these complicated issues.    NEW  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  CERAWEEK ONLINE PREMIUM  SERVICE  CERAWeek Online will deliver a comprehensive online  experience of the CERAWeek proceedings, featuring daily highlights and  interviews with speakers, live simulcasts of keynote and plenary sessions,  on-demand access to a wide variety of sessions, and online briefings by  CERA experts delivered via the web in an easy-to-use format.  THE HUB OF COMPETITION:  THE FUTURE OF THE GERMAN GAS MARKET  This new major multiclient  study assesses the key issues in the German gas market on both a strategic  and an operational level. The study provides a framework for thinking  about such issues as industry structure, strategy, and market  development.  NEW REALITIES, NEW RISKS:  NORTH AMERICAN POWER AND GAS THROUGH 2020  An authoritative CERA  multiclient study that provides analysis and scenario-based insight into  the future of the North American power and gas industries, including  detailed long-term regionally specific market and price outlooks through  2020.   NEW  RESEARCH  INDIA-PAKISTAN WAR?  RISKS AND IMPLICATIONS Prospects are growing that a short, sharp war  could occur between India and Pakistan over the next several weeks. It is  not inevitable; diplomacy could still pull the two parties  back.  OPEC TILTS TO MARKET SHARE With demand growth evaporating,  OPEC's efforts to gain non-OPEC participation in production restraint  reflect its growing concern about market share now that prices are no  longer rising enough to offset cuts in production. During 2001 OPEC lost  market share by cutting its quota a total of 3.5 million barrels per day  (mbd) while non-OPEC production increased nearly 600,000 barrels per  day.  NATURAL GAS WATCH: A SHORTAGE OF DEMAND Since January,  natural gas prices have fluctuated between $2.00 per MMBtu at the Henry  Hub and $10.00, a result of weather, fuel switching, and increasing  supplies. Loss of demand due to economic weakness is exacerbated by the  impact of the tragedy of September 11. Lower prices have already slowed  drilling activity. Although ample storage levels will guard against last  year's peaks, gas prices will likely to continue to oscillate in the near  term.  TWENTY YEARS LATER--A NEW SPIN ON WIND Energy security and  environmental quality considerations continue to increase the level of  interest in renewable energy. Wind power is and will likely remain a  leading beneficiary of the demand for more diversified and ""greener""  power. However, when considering future market prospects, the competitive  advantages of wind must be balanced with certain realities.  SPANISH  GAS AUCTION: A PRECEDENT FOR EUROPE? The recent auction of contract gas  in Spain represents an early initiative both to release gas from  preexisting long-term contracts and to make it available to aspiring  market entrants. As such, CERA believes it could provide a precedent for  other European markets (and for their regulators) where release gas  programs have not so far been on the public agenda.  RECESSION  DEEPENS DOWN PHASE IN POWER MARKETS The US power generation business is  entering the bust phase of a boom/bust cycle. Most regions have recently  crossed an inflection point from tightness in the past to surplus over the  next few years.  For more details on any of these reports, go to: http://www.cera.com/news/highlights .   MULTIMEDIA HIGHLIGHTS  BEYOND THE CRISIS:  NEAR-TERM GLOBAL ENERGY FUTURES  CERA President and CEO Joseph A.  Stanislaw answers clients' questions on CERA's new global energy scenario  initiative.  NEW REALITIES, NEW  RISKS  CERA Senior Director Lawrence J. Makovich highlights the key  themes of CERA's new multiclient study, New Realities, New Risks: North  American Power and Gas Through 2020.  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND  ELECTRIC POWER  CERA Director Steven Taub discusses CERA's new  Information Technologies and Electric Power multiclient study.  EUROPEAN  GAS ISSUES  (Clients Only) CERA Director Simon Blakey sat down  recently with CERA's New Media team to discuss some of the critical issues  currently facing the industry and the short-term research focus of the  European Natural Gas service.   CERA  IN THE NEWS  CERA and Sun Microsystems announce the  release of GLOBAL OIL TRENDS 2002  The global oil industry is beset  by turmoil in the pricing of its basic commodity--crude oil. How does an  industry so important to the world's economic system survive in an  environment of such extreme price volatility for its commodity? Global Oil  Trends highlights key developments--What are the trends in oil demand and  supply? Which countries are seeing increases in reserves and what is  refining capacity globally?

Dear Mark,

Hope you are well!

I've attached the confirmation for the EOL bankruptcy swaps where ENA will be 
the contracting entity.  I've followed the format of the online ENA swap 
confirm but kept the economics the same as for the European bankruptcy swap 
confirm.  Please let me know if you are happy with this.  

Thanks, Edmund.

how was the holiday. i hope not as exhausting as mine.
i assume that Cindy Olsen has yet to get you an answer.  Enron may get a
little bump in anticipation of a positive earnings release.  This may give
us an opportunity to create some sort of hedge/collar.  Let me know as soon
as you find out.

1486,"Hey Rita..

Since the volume is so small and does match the amount listed in TXOK it is highly possible that this an error. I would say that we just need to correct are volumes to reflect the actuals Ruth provided, especially since I cannot identify where the original numbers on the spreadsheet first came from.

Phil...Chris any thoughts on the matter???

Thanks for the schedule Maria.  I don't know if it matters that much, but for the ENA storage on NGPL, the numbers are off a little according to the pipe statements and the email from Ruth on March 20th.  I show the volumes to be as follows:

NGPL - LA :  1,336,843
NGPL - TX:    758,666
NGPL - TXOK:  472
  Total          2,095,981

The difference from your schedule other than the distribution between points is the 472 which appears to be double counted.  Maybe my numbers are off, but just thought I'd mention it.  Let me know what you think.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk 
September 15,  2000
Raymond Cote
Vice President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond  Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based  consulting firm offering financial management solutions that 
combine advisory  and systems development services to &corporations and 
financial  institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to credit and  market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or academic  journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as a  variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure.  The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the  liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

On the first screen, titled Welcome to MSN Messenger Service!, click Next ->

Click the ""OK"" button. If the connection is successful, you should be able to see a contact list. This is where you can view your contacts status and start communications. To add a person to your contact list, click the Add button. For general help, questions, or to learn the new emoticons ( Telephone receiver <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/emphone.gif>,  Boy <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/emboy.gif>,  Thumbs up <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/thumbu.gif>, etc.) For direct access to this link, click here <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/HelpWindow_msg.asp?Topic=InfoTech.asp&INI=msgv35.ini&SearchTerm=ffogol&S_Text=signing+in&H_APP=MSN%20Messenger%20Service&BrandID=MSMSGS&Filter=msgrxchg>.

Subject:	US West Hydro on the Rise, Demand Low - CERA Monthly Briefing


Title: A Moving Supply and Demand Picture
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2958;


***********************************************************************

US WEST HYDRO ON THE RISE, DEMAND LOW

Shifting 2002 electricity demand drivers and improvement of hydroelectric
conditions in the US West continue to change the outlook for 2002 and beyond.
Although 2002 demand will still contract from 2001 levels, CERA's updated
outlook calls for modestly stronger demand than previously forecasted. The weak
January fundamentals that have dragged down Henry Hub and western regional gas
prices should continue through February.

*  The level of voluntary and price-responsive electricity conservation in
California appears to be falling as the supply crisis abates.

*  Gas prices have been kept at bay by the lack of evidence of the expected
decline in US supply and weak national economic trends that point to further
delay in the rebound of industrial and power generation demand.

*  The abundant western snowpacks that will be shown to the world during the
winter Olympics are having an impact on regional energy markets.

Sorry about not getting something out to you yesterday.  Chris Stokley was trying to get some additional information back from some folks in Houston.  We got quite a bit of information yesterday and have the draft almost completed.  We will get you something to review by your 2:30pm time frame.

Do you want it via email?  Let me know if there is someone other than yourself you want me to send it to so they can get it printed out for you.

1511,"The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.

Subject: Dec. 7 - SDG&E Press Release


CRECers,

Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
transportation to the CA border.

Subject:	Condensate Hauling

As most of you are now aware of, OneOk has hired a new trucking company to haul off the pipeline drips and condensate tanks at our locations where drip is contained in the southwest Kansas area.
There has been an appointment set to meet with this new trucking company representative on Monday, Sept. 24th at the Liberal Region office complex at 1:00 p.m.
The main focus will be for the teams involved to show the vendor where these locations are that have previously been picked up by WEGO, and to make arrangements for them to review previous schedules to haul these condensates. What they have requested from the teams are maps to each point along with driving directions that are specific to each location. It comes to my mind that maybe we could provide them with a copy of our emergency response driving directions that the teams should have on hand.
It was also brought to my attention, from my management, that this tasks needs to be handed off to the region operations management people so that they may coordinate the activities to their needs and schedules. It was also discussed that proper safety and procedure practices need be recognized by this new company which will be entering ETS facilities to provide their services for OneOk.
This would also be a prime opportunity to request that driver ""run tickets"" be left at all locations that drip is removed from. This would not only provide us with audit trail material for the future, but can give us documentation for comparisons at the places where we have load-out meters installed.
With these suggestions considered, maybe we can go forward from here with our continued services and work ethics with OneOk to provide a more positive customer relationship.
Thanks you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.

P.S.     All teams do not need to have a rep. present at this meeting. Randy Howard, myself and a few others that I have asked to provide the maps from are all that will be needed.
"
1521,"Ken,  I just wanted to say thanks for all that you and Enron have done for me.  I know you trusted people close to you and they let you down for that Im sorry.  I have always believed in you and what you stand for.  I  know it took tremendous courage to do what you have done over the last couple of weeks.  Whether the people at Enron like it or not I believe you put us first.  I trust that your decision was the right thing given the circumstances. Yes, Im deeply hurt by the last month but the true spirit of Enron will last within me forever.   I started at this company a mid level IT Administrator and I am now a seasoned Director level technologist and leader.  I have had 4 promotions in the last 5 1/2 years.  I have been challenged by this environment.  I believe that I can go anywhere and be successful because of meeting those challenges.  No where else could have provided me these opportunities. In return Im going to stay committed and have faith that due to that committment the Enron spirit will live on.  With all the bad I wanted to remind you of the good. My years of employment with Enron have been the best of my career.  No matter what happens I know I will be fine. I truly wish you and your family the best.  

Take Care

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

The Rams originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collateral ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage.   Rams coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three weeks.   ""They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to four weeks,"" Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New Orleans Saints on October 28.   ""We'll see,"" Faulk said. ""It's kind of early to say, but you never know.""     Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exchange on Carolina's second posse! ss! ion, losing another fumble when his arm was hit as he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All three turnovers led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished 21-of-39 for 196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserve for now.    Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/14/01 Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters returns.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a reserve at this point.   Lamar Smith ,! R! B MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/14/01 Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/14/01  Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right.   Glyn Milburn , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14/01 Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider droppin! g ! Bennett altogether.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat.   Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Fighti! n ! Farmers Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.  Travis Taylor , WR BAL - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore passing game.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc   FB10NF

1538,"Megan, 

I have changed the pricing on deals 452491 and 452475 for October flows to 
mtr 25000200.  These flows should be priced at $.10 + 1/2 % fuel.  The $.11 
that Lone Star billed us is incorrect on the last deal.  I'm not sure about 
the rates for mtr 20014903.  The person who can tell us should be in 
tomorrow.  I will leave a note for her.  We should have similar deal tickets 
for Dec forward.  I will check with Mark and Trisha.

Have you been able to work out these transport pricing differences for Oct. 
2000?  We have only been able to pay $4,000.00 of the $28,000.00 invoice.  
The pricing for Nov. 2000 (deal 452491) has problems too.  We have $0.01 for 
11/3 at meter 20014804 and TXU is billing us $0.10 at meter 25000200 and 
$0.02 at meter 20014903 for the entire month.

I have also noticed that we are not accruing any transport for Dec 2000 
forward.  We have received the Dec. 2000 invoice from TXU, but we do not have 
a deal to pay them.  We should be getting Jan. 2001 next week.  Is there a 
deal for these months?

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,

Subject:	FW: Storage allocations

FYI, with regards to item (3) below:
SBS will remain off after storage allocations are completed.  This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  

Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

Jill,
Lynn and Steve January want to change the storage allocation from after confirmation to after regular allocations during all cycles except timely (for the timely cycle it storage allocations will be after confirmations).

I looked at the code and it seemed to be pretty self contained module.  But a few things to look out for:

1) Process for saving to the database
	- after allocations
	- after storage allocations
	- after confirmations
2) rollback of allocations to include storage
3) SBS - currently it turned off for the storage allocation process.  How does it get turned back on?  Business group has to make a decision on how whether SBS needs to turned on or off for the confirmation process

Please let maggie or gerry know the time estimate.

Thanx

"
1554,"I don't think we can wait. We need FERC solutions in SAP (and perhaps the 
data warehouse) relatively quickly. 
We have an ""enterprise"" issue localized in ETS -if that helps getting any 
action.

Fundamentally, through my recent ""investigation"" I have become acquainted 
with numerous significant FERC module and FERC related issues -with little 
apparent solution to date. The items are being worked...

Composite depreciation is not correct  -millions of $
SAP natural accounts do not reconcile to the FERC module -the FERC trial 
balance does NOT balance
Labor distribution true-ups are not correct for FERC purposes -costs are 
being misallocated  (this was originally deemed a show stopper)
AFUDC is not calculating consistently with pre SAP methodologies
FERC ledgers are not available
FERC ""Users"" were ready to test out the FERC data warehouse but that 
opportunity was nixed by the decisions below
We are unable to obtain detailed benefit information for rate purposes
Benefits have been charged out incorrectly (nearly resolved)
Anxiety issue >We have little confidence we'll be able to efficiently prepare 
timely year end FERC Form2 reports* for Enron pipelines (submission deadlines 
for which are well before any Project Sunrise timetable.)

* there is voluminous revenue/volume, financial, property and tax related 
data required for this document, all of which has to be stated in FERC format.

Do you think it better that I wait and see what comes of this, or because I 
have a singular need that I cause a small group to come togehter and focus on 
this?     The fact that there is no solution is the issue and no solution 
merely means I have to find one, since I don't have the option of saying it's 
too hard or the system can't do it.    On the other hand I'm sure I don't 
know all the answers so I'm not sure of what the right process even is.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse

To all:

Hope this clarifies--

We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle.
Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:
 1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.
 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.
 3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.
 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of 
SAP.

Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the 
most efficient, cost effective way possible.
That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module, 
could be through another avenue.
None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all 
have ideas).

I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand 
-- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan.
We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, 
etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.

However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the 
forefront of any reporting solution.
If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I 
need the education.
If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to 
postpone.
I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the 
delay worthwhile.

One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the 
project, is in California.
We may want to wait on his participation.

I believe we are all on the same page.

Why wouldn't we?  ETS has a specific gap that needs to be addressed, and we

DW as the solution, unless the ISC has been given ample opportunity to 
propose a solution.  Be sure to go that route, too!

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is ""what's the best approach for 
solving it""? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=""=_7D27A7DE.F594F634""


For the benefit of all concerned and listserv:
Williams testimony was  provided in a jumbled fashion in a large box which contains
(1) a cover letter  to the Secretary that mentions there is being  filed a redacted and unredacted version of Elliot's testimony
(2) the box provided to me has no confidentiality markings on it and simply  sasys Box 1 of 1;
(3) in the box is a CD with a label  that says exhibits to testimony  of Elliot and indicated those materials are protected--the CD was not mentioned  in the transmittal letter, so withut opening it, one does not know its contents;  
(4)also in the box, without any markings, tabbed items 1-21, attached to  that by a rubber band lare enghty spread sheets which on the first sheet  indicvated that sheet is protected, with remaining sheets covering heat  rate data, followed by another tab 17 with items A-F, none of which is labelled  as confidential, and a further rubber banded tabbed items A through  N.
 
None of this material except as noted is labelled confidential and it does  not appear that Eliiott's testimony and the required detailed narrative  sumary  is among the hard copy mmaterial described above.
 
If the Secretary received this pottage, I would be doubtful that its office  understood what is protected and what is not. 
 
Beyond that, the brief summary of the Heintz testimony is inadequate and  needs to be revised since it simply says he describes, explains, etc. without  providing the essence of the material or the material points.
 
In other words, the filing as it was provided to me is haphazard and a mess  and an explanation is in order togetether with proper provision tome of two  tabbed hard copies of any testimony Willimans wishes to sponsor and a clear  delineation of what is protected and what is not.  The same followup should  be made with the Secretary in the event that Williams wishes to comply with the  Protective Order and the Rules of Practice.

Hi Hunter,
I recently joined the A/A program as a Senior Analyst as of November 2001 on recommendations from Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, and Nicole La and I would like to speak with you on any opportunities that you may have within the Gas Fundamentals group.  I am currently working for Paul Racicot on the EBS trading desk as a metro capacity trader but I am interested in pursuing other opportunities within Enron.  I am ultimately interested in joining the Gas trading track and believe the fundamentals group would be an excellent place to start.  I've attached a copy of my resume and two recommendation letters one from Nicole La and one Joe Edwards, who heads up the bandwidth capacity trading desk, for you to review.  If you have any questions please call me at x34212.  Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, Nicole La and Joe Edwards would also be happy to speak with you regarding my performance and potential at Enron.

		 Subject: CA Supply Realities

Attached is a memo comparing the CEC's forecasted supply and a more realistic 
look at what additional resources might be available this summer.

The bottom line is that:

1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this 
summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that 
expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw 
significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated 
these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed 
from running at higher than normal capacities.

2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected 
supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It 
is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, 
if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local 
communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, 
these units are likely to be uneconomical.

3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or 
other generation units that are running up against their operating hour 
limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local 
air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to 
seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed 
standards.

4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of 
the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the 
limitations on run hours for back-up generation at ""essential public 
services"" the increase in DG is expected from ""clean"" sources, not diesel 
emergency generators.

5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by 
this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process 
and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for ""clean"" sources of 
generation in critical areas.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Jon, I am speaking with SMED first thing tomorrow morning (between 7 and 8) around their gas needs (they appear to finally be ready to get this one off their plates).

Can you get me fresh 1, 2, 3 and 5 year prices out of Nov. 1st.

Update 12/18/01

ERCOT has successfully loaded 5 867_03 finals into our systems - these 5
ESI IDs have completed the Drop to TDSP.  Enron should have received the
867_03 finals for each ESI ID.

10443720003625902
10443720005335301
10443720004233186
10443720007738300
10443720006522263

ERCOT is working with TXU on the 4 ESI ID listed below.

10443720004431331 - wrong DUNS sent in the file from TXU, didn't
translate correctly at ERCOT.  TXU needs to please resend.
10443720006871343 - need file name from TXU, ERCOT does not show receipt
of file.
10443720003630335 - need file name from TXU, ERCOT does not show receipt
of file.
10443720003001397 - need file name from TXU, ERCOT does not show receipt
of file.

ERCOT is working internal on the 2 ESI ID listed below.
10443720003625902 - ERCOT has file from TXU, working to determine why
ERCOT system did not update to Drop to TDSP, will process manually to
drop if necessary, once we confirm that Enron does have the 867_03
final.
10443720005335301 - ERCOT has file from TXU, working to determine why
ERCOT system did not update to Drop to TDSP, will process manually to
drop if necessary, once we confirm that Enron does have the 867_03
final.

Please note, the meter read date from TXU is stated to be 12/13 for all
11 ESI IDs.  Once we do get the information loaded into ERCOT system, it
will reflect that Enron Energy Services stopped as CR of record on
12/13/01.

Questions, please contact me at 512-248-3171.

Joe / Thane

TXU was not able to send ERCOT the files as they had stated earlier this
week.  Here is the meter read information for 7 of the 11 meters.  The
other 4 will be read today.  The files (867_03) will be sent on Monday,
all still with a meter read date of 12/13/01.  This will update ERCOT's
system to show that Enron is no longer the REP of record for these 11
ESI IDs, once the files are processed.

Thane, please note, if I am correct, when initials are run for 12/14,
12/15 (as they are run 3 days later) the load may still show for Enron,
however on final statements, it will be fixed, as the meter data will
have been run through our system to update correctly.

Please call me if questions.

Thank you

Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

Dear Premium Member:

Do you need income now, or will you need it in the near
future? Have you made considerable money and now wish to protect
it? Are you retired?

Answer yes to any one of these questions and you'll want to
learn more about Bonds. And if you haven't looked at bonds in a
while, you're in for a surprise. They've changed. There are more
types, more bond funds, and more volatility.

So, we suggest you make your first bond venture boning up on
bonds. We've made that very easy, and even added a lot of fun to
the process, too! (Not to mention the great rewards you can get.)

Just try our new Investing Classroom Bond track at

You'll find 20 courses divided into two sections. They take
you from the basics to information about specific types of bonds.
Here's a sampling of the topics you'll master easily and quickly:

Bonds 100:

Buying Bonds
Immunization
The Process of Issuing Bonds
..plus five more

Bonds 200:
Collateralized Mortgage Obligation
Zero Coupon Securities
TIGRs, CATS, AND LIONs
STRIPS
Treasury Inflation-Adjusted Securities

There's more, too. After each course, you'll reinforce your
knowledge with a short quiz. And you'll get credits for each
question you answer correctly. Our new Bond track gives you the
chance to pick up 100 credits. That's enough for some pretty
handsome rewards.

You can redeem your credits for great Morningstar Rewards.

reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the 
need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in 
writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an 
efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define 
and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, 
then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On 
the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully 
understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an Enron 
publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if 
so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an 
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Recovery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement


On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a
rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to
resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related
hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also
address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The
ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week
so
that I can send in the required letter.

Michelle thanks, from the logistics point of view I would recommend to do Guatemala,fly to Nicaragua as it's a short 30 min. flight.
>From there Panama City is about 1hr.15min.
The next  jump would be  to Venezuela where VENGAS and ACCRO (30 min from Caracas) where you could do a direct flight home back to Houston.
That would be my recommendation.
I will be checking with Guatemala on the  November date.

I'm thinking the week of November 5-7 because I thought I would be in Toronto and now I don't have to go.  I'd like to do Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela in one big trip.  Help me with logistics here.  I know there are a couple of places in Venezuela, but where else did you need me and are we trying to combine any of these offices?

Please review the attached EnronOnline press releases which are scheduled for 
release at 10:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.  The purpose of the separate 
releases (the counterparties will make their own releases in addition) is to 
communicate the message that our goal is to continue to increase liquidity.  
One way to do that is give the greatest possible number of  buyers and 
sellers the opportunity to see our prices.

Please send any comments to me by 9:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.

1612,"Dale,

Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you 
mentioned 
another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  company 
employees on a case-study.

The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the 
purchase price should
we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us 
to evaluate the model and
come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model 
internally.

Please, let me know more about this option.

We are primarily interested in a long-term natural gas model and the database 
for North America.  
Unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite, we don't 
have resources to spend too much time on it.

Of course, a trading desk may be interested in the short term
version of the model. I shall talk to them about it.

Subject: MarketPoint License Agreement


John/Vince:

I really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people.  Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people.

As I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for
MarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product, which includes

? North American gas, short and long term
? North American electricity, short and long term
? World gas
? Western European gas
? World oil

We are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western European
gas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into
MarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are
presently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business.

As I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and will
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at
the meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately 
 the fully
bundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the
software licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the
electric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for 
 the software license plus the data license for a
total of $55,000 annually.  This is just under 
 the fully bundled price.  I
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from
MarketPoint,s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to &scale up8 to another
model or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the gas
decision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward.)

I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of our
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same
time its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the
benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business.

If you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount
MarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest you
begin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1 
 day training seminar.
Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 
 day training seminar.
Thereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks
later.

Thanks again, and all the best.  If there is some item from the meeting that
I might have forgotten to send, please remind me.  My notes don't show
anything, but I was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted.

1614,"I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.  Retail guys periodically ask about AZ but there is little to tell them.  If we see a worthy cause, let's go for it.

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

1619,"The mapping problem mentioned below is a power desk problem only.  The 
mapping problem is purely between the interface of the gas and power trading 
systems and does not affect the book if it is strictly a gas trader's gas 
book.  There was one instance when a gas trader's transactions were 
incorrectly bridged to a power trader's gas book through EOL.  The root of 
this problem was with the EOL bridge not the interface mapping.

The procedure to set up a gas book for power traders includes communication 
to IT regarding the appropriate interface mapping of the book.  If for some 
reason the mapping does not occur, the position will be mapped to a 'dummy' 
default desk.  We will be alerted when positions are loaded to the 'dummy' 
account on a nightly basis in order to investigate the problem and ensure 
that positions do no get lost in the system.  

If anyone needs to further discuss the problem we have been having and why it 
is only the power world that is affected, please give me a call.  

Thanks,

Subject: Potential Gas System Exposure

For some period of time, various West Power desks have been the default desk 
which received gas positions for new books that were not properly setup in 
TAGG.  I have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get West 
Power out of this problem.  I'm happy with the result from the West Power 
point of view.  

I am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists.  If 
someone does a gas deal and hasn't set up a new book properly and doesn't 
carefully track his/her position, the trade goes into a dummy book that 
nobody manages.  Days, weeks, or months later you discover the trade and take 
the hit or the gain.  I think that this risk is real because we were the ones 
finding the misplaced gas trades before -- not the gas desk with the 
misplaced trade.  Now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes 
that some of his/her position is missing.

These are the facts as I understand them.  I'm sure that Stacey White, Steve 
Nat, and Monica Lande could fill you in with more detailed information.  Let 
me know if I can be of further assistance.

Tim,

Steve has described the problem accurately.  Setting up a dummy book solves 
the problem for us, but not for Enron as a whole.  If no one monitors the 
dummy book on the daily basis (which probably won't happen if there is no 
ownership), then you still have the possibility of positions falling into 
that book and never showing up in the book that they were intended.  Why 
can't a process be put in place for the initial set-up of a book in TAGG?

Subject: RE: Remaining problem with West tot


Tim,  The root problem was related to the default mapping logic in the 
'interface' job that moves the ERMS gas calc results to the portcalc results 
tables.  If mapping logic is not set up for a new book, the job was 
defaulting the gas deals to the ST-PLT desk.  The default mapping has been 
changed to a dummy  ZZ_erms book, which will prevent the deals from showing 
up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated.

In reference to Beth's concerns... turns out this was a limitation in our 
production code, not an IT change to production data, so we should be OK on 
that front.  

The long-term solution would be to remove the hard-coded logic, set-up table 
structures, and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen.  Given our 
other priorities, and the default logic change, we will not pursue this 
option.

Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Steve

The problem is not that we should enter a reversing trade in the system as 
this would misrepresent the positions across the board.  The problem is that 
the position belongs to another book within Enpower.  The users have no 
access to the screens which define where our gas books are mapped in Enpower; 
therefore, IT has to manually define the correct mapping for us.  When the 
manual fix has not been made, we have true positions for one book mapped to 
another book.

Sorry about this.  A better question to ask is why are systems people 
manipulating data?  Why can't the users put on a reversing trade?  I'm having

many times we screw ourselves up because IT does this.

The EOL help desk received a call from Isabelle Ealet at J Aron in London 
(0171 774 2103).  She was asking them why she could not trade with her id and 
password that she had been given.

I called her and explained that she could not use a Guest Id to trade and 
told her that she needed to send in a UK PA (explained to her the location of 
the form on the web site).  She said she would send one to us.

Then she told me that it was not a problem anyway because she called her New 
York office and asked them to give her and id - they set her up as a sub 
user.  She then told me that she transacted a deal in London for EN590.  I 
told her that her PA would not cover this and I am not sure she understood 
this ?

Therefore she will have transacted in London under a US PA - correct ?  
Please advise as to how we are to deal with this.

Thanks

Arfan

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

"
1631,"Welcome back, again.  You will have to let me know when you have baby pictures in the office - would love to see them.  

Last week, I orchestrated some changes within my operations organization which will free up more of my time to focus on the successful commercialization of mid and back office services.  I have asked Bob Hall to lead operations for Enron Americas, with Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary operations), Jeff Gossett (Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (Power Risk) and Leslie Reeves (Confirmations and Settlements) reporting directly to him.  He is enthusiastic about the additional responsibility and I believe that he will do an excellent job for Enron Americas.  

Other changes include appointing Kevin Sweeney as head of operations for EIM, with Brenda Herod reassigned as part of a project team that will work on the EES assimilation.  I have also asked Beth Apollo to play a project management lead role in the assimilation of EES into EWS.  

I will be glad to fill you in on more details on any of these changes.  The result is to give more responsibility to several key players - stretching them, but I will be there to support and coach them in their new roles if needed.  Plus, I can now devote significantly more time to the commercialization effort.  In that regard, I did move to the 27th floor (next to Piper) while you were out on leave.  

I wanted to share these changes with you before a memo goes out across the organization next Monday.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  --Sally

1633,"Apologies - here is the corrected version.
"
1634,"We have all but the last of the exceptions actualized for 405.  TJ is writing code to take the customer search up to the day level and automatically allocate these records.  There is one day with a 35MW difference between the variance and the allocations - I will chase that down and fix it in the morning.

I have the last of the numbers ready to send to Seattle, showing the breakout between us and them.  There was a swing of about 104k in Import Deviation - we estimated a charge of about 15k, and the final actualization shows a credit of approximately 88k.  Of that credit, roughly 84k belongs to Seattle.  I will e-mail the document to Steve in the morning.

Once the 405's are fully actualized, we will transfer them to Oracle, set them to A, then run the Total 407 process (allocates remaining dollar variances to ECTstCA) for Prelims.  Set the newest actualizations to A, run a Flash and do the last cross-check to the Invoice.

For Finals, we have seven days to run through the actualization process, then transfer to Oracle, set to M, and run a Final flash.  We will then be able to provide details to Houston Settlements.

Anticipate completion of Preliminaries and Finals by mid-Thursday.

Subject:	Deviation Actualization Update

Charge types 402, 403 and 404 have been fully re-allocated and are set to A.  

Finals for the regular stuff have been completed; incomplete actualization found for 9/5 and will need to be re-run on Monday.  Data had not been set to M as the allocations were not correct.  Did not discuss the date with Brett.

Charge type 405 (Import Deviation) is being re-run, with exceptions created that will require manual allocations.  The volume is still not allocating properly and research must be done to determine what is causing the bad allocations.  I may need some help looking at the data, if help can be found.

What is outstanding for Prelim actualization:
Finish 405 allocations, upload to Oracle, and set them to A.
Run Total 407 to assign remaining dollar variances to ECTstCA.
Run entire process, comparing A's to F's for Finals
Upload Finals to Oracle and set to M
Re-run 9/5 Final
Run Flash reports for A and M to double-check a match to the Invoices.

Still shooting for a COB Tuesday for all.

Subject:	Deviation Actualization Update

We have transferred new allocations for Gen and Export Dev based on the changes to the formula that I gave to TJ.  Tomorrow we will work on redoing Load Dev using the same formula changes, then we need to finish researching whatever is wrong with Import Deviation and get that one done.  

Once all four are done and transferred, then we can do the Total 407 part, which will identify remaining dollar variances and allocate that amount to ECTstCA.  The code hasn't been fully tested yet, so completion of this part may be delayed until cob Monday.

I am finished with September Finals for the non-deviation stuff through the 28th, and will have the last two days done tomorrow morning.

I anticipate having all of September completely actualized (for both Preliminary and Final) by cob Tuesday.

TJ looking into the formulas, with Anna's assistance as best she can by telephone and IM.  We had to dump the existing export deviation records and re-do the manuals that had been previously added incorrectly, so that type will have to be run through the process again for sure.

No additional progress on any of the other things that need to be done for September, with the exception of 3 days worth of Finals actualized without deviations.

Tomorrow is another day, and if Anna is back we'll get that much closer to completion of Prelims by weeks' end.  At least we didn't have a database crash today.

Subject:	Deviation Actualization Update

Continue to have difficulties matching up volumes for Import Deviation, caused by an internal database functionality problem.  

Have analyzed the Instructed/Uninstructed settlement data provided by the ISO and created formulas for variance identification and allocation for all types of deviation, as well as special case handling (exceptions or export deviation for example).  Also looking into Region differences and working with Anna on how to incorporate region into the process.

Anna has added the functionality to be able to actualize by settlement file SeqID, but this needs to be tested (settlement database crash prohibited proper testing today).

Reviewed TJ's functionality for allocating dollar variances in Total 407 (after volumetric and related dollar variances are allocated, remaining dollar variances are applied to ECTstCA); provided feedback on same.

Need to accomplish the following  to wrap-up September:

Review formulas currently in database - revise if needed
Test formulas
Obtain valid allocations for variances (especially for 405)
Check results on new allocations for 402, 403 and 404 to see if formula changes made any difference, and if so, is difference good
Delete existing allocations (based on current formulas, may be invalid)
Send new allocations up to FSP
Run total 407
Re-run whole process for Finals
Finish Final actualizations (Brett left off at the 19th)

Anticipate completion of deviation stuff for Prelims complete by end of week, and finals by Tuesday next.

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In 
addition to the Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric 
charge, 
the applicable surcharges and fuel. 
? 

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation capacity for electronic bid (""package or packages""): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
Transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available transportation capacity under the specified package OR 
multiple 
rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation 
capacity under the specified package.? If the same Shipper submits multiple 
bids, 
the highest present value for such package of available transportation 
capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for 
the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate 
is less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid 
Rate 
x FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the 
maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest 
Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied 
shipper 
will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an improved bid within 
24 
hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed to (801) 
584-7076 
to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still exists, such capacity 
shall 
be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than 
indicated for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are 
just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues 
relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican 
counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next 
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?  
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we 
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed 
with respect to the online and offline transactions?

Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the

Craig,
 
In the month of August, EPME nominated the requested volumes to 9JZ2 (Citizen's San Juan Pool Contract).  The nomination was not confirmed by your operations group, thus the nominated volume was reduced to zero.  To answer your question, I recommend confirming the gas EPME nominates.  If you have any questions about the nominating procedure, please contact Jason Kelm (713-420-6038).  In regards the month of September, the first day the gas was confirmed was 9-8-01.  So far, 10,313 mmbtus have been delivered.

I sent the message below at the end of August and the one below that at the end of July.  

The only problem is that NO gas was scheduled during August and I can't find any gas for September!  Now the imbalance has grown larger instead of smaller!!  

I also need gas for October.  What do I need to do to get this scheduled and confirmed for October?

Attached is the template to be used for the 2002 Strategic and Operating Plan.  It includes the Income Statement, Indirect Cash Flow Statement, and numerous supplemental schedules.  

As discussed previously, this template requires more detail compared to what has been required in past years.  Some of the detail sheets are linked to certain lines on the summary sheets, so if you encounter an error message regarding a cell being locked, it will be because there is a more detailed sheet for input for that particular item.  Some sheets include check figures, so please make sure these are all reconciled before submitting the file.

A few reminders:
1. Please do not add any lines or alter in any way the 'Format' or 'PRMA' worksheets.
2. Please round all amounts to one decimal place, even within the cell (for example, don't have a cell show 45.2 and have 45.24395135 as the actual number in the cell).
3. Please do not include any embedded links in the file you submit.

With regard to Operating Expenses, there is an SAP Cost Element Mapping worksheet included to assist you in determining where expenses are mapped.

Also, please note that the due date for this file is THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4.

If you have any questions, please contact me (income) or Greg Adams (cash flow).

Thanks,

"
1647,"
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

>From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

"
1649,"Thanks to everyone for their work on the Senate hearing.  There are a couple 
of follow-up items:

Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams, Sen Wyden is very interested in 
identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO (and PX to the 
extent it's still relevant) to make the market work better.  We have written 
this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.  Alan -- 
please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.  I think we should 
identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that 
could be sent to the FERC.
Murkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the 
fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is 
necessary  to address the California crisis.  We have identified the need for 
open access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the 
2-4 month time frame.  Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.  Sue -- 
could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get 
them to Linda?
Finally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to 
""price gouge"" -- yes, that's what she said.  She appealed to everyone's 
community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while 
California struggles to fix its problems.  I think we should send a response 
from Ken.  Jeff -- please take a cut and get to Linda.  I think the basic 
messages should be:  we are actively working on solutions with California 
policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively 
pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.  We should also explain the 
nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we 
identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc.

Hi, Vince,

How are you doing? I called Wed to set up a meeting with you, unfortunately 
you were out of town. Since I just got my computer and email account set up 
today, it was not that convenient to contact you. Please let me know when you 
are available. Please see the following for the interesting article about 
Enron, and it is exactly what you have been worried about and now it is 
starting to catch Wall Street's attention. So I belive what you have been 
promoting to do is very constructive to the company.

In addition, please let me know if you need any help with Tiger Team. I 
didn't forget yesterday's conference, but I was so tied up in a meeting and 
couldn't leave. The learning curve is quite steep for a freshhand like me at 
the very beginning. 

You are such a remarkable person, and I feel lucky I got the chance to work 
for you. I really appreciate your help and your kindness to me, and I benefit 
from it tremendously. Please please let me know if there is anything I could 
help.

Best Wishes!

Is Enron Overpriced?
It's in a bunch of complex businesses. Its financial
statements are nearly impenetrable. So why is Enron
trading at such a huge multiple?

   In Hollywood parlance, the ""It Girl"" is someone who commands the
spotlight at any given moment--you know, like Jennifer Lopez or Kate
Hudson. Wall Street is a far less glitzy place, but there's still
such a thing as an ""It Stock."" Right now, that title belongs to
Enron, the Houston energy giant. While tech stocks were bombing at
the box office last year, fans couldn't get enough of Enron, whose
shares returned 89%. By almost every measure, the company turned in a
virtuoso performance: Earnings increased 25%, and revenues more than
doubled, to over $100 billion. Not surprisingly, the critics are
gushing. ""Enron has built unique and, in our view, extraordinary
franchises in several business units in very large markets,"" says
Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer.

   Along with ""It"" status come high multiples and high expectations.
Enron now trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That's more
than 2 1/2 times the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more
than twice that of the S&P 500, and about on a par with new-economy
sex symbol Cisco Systems. Enron has an even higher opinion of itself.
At a late-January meeting with analysts in Houston, the company
declared that it should be valued at $126 a share, more than 50%
above current levels. ""Enron has no shame in telling you what it's
worth,"" says one portfolio manager, who describes such gatherings as
""revival meetings."" Indeed, First Call says that 13 of Enron's 18
analysts rate the stock a buy.
   But for all the attention that's lavished on Enron, the company
remains largely impenetrable to outsiders, as even some of its
admirers are quick to admit. Start with a pretty straightforward
question: How exactly does Enron make its money? Details are hard to
come by because Enron keeps many of the specifics confidential for
what it terms ""competitive reasons."" And the numbers that Enron does
present are often extremely complicated. Even quantitatively minded
Wall Streeters who scrutinize the company for a living think so. ""If
you figure it out, let me know,"" laughs credit analyst Todd Shipman
at S&P. ""Do you have a year?"" asks Ralph Pellecchia, Fitch's credit
analyst, in response to the same question.

   To skeptics, the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enron's
pricey stock. Even owners of the stock aren't uniformly sanguine.
""I'm somewhat afraid of it,"" admits one portfolio manager. And the
inability to get behind the numbers combined with ever higher
expectations for the company may increase the chance of a nasty
surprise. ""Enron is an earnings-at-risk story,'' says Chris Wolfe,
the equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private bank, who
despite his remark is an Enron fan. ""If it doesn't meet earnings,
[the stock] could implode.""

   What's clear is that Enron isn't the company it was a decade ago.
In 1990 around 80% of its revenues came from the regulated gas-
pipeline business. But Enron has been steadily selling off its old-
economy iron and steel assets and expanding into new areas. In 2000,
95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its operating profits came
from ""wholesale energy operations and services."" This business, which
Enron pioneered, is usually described in vague, grandiose terms like
the ""financialization of energy""--but also, more simply, as ""buying
and selling gas and electricity."" In fact, Enron's view is that it
can create a market for just about anything; as if to underscore that
point, the company announced last year that it would begin trading
excess broadband capacity.

   But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is
mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a ""logistics
company"" that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity
and figures out the most cost-effective way to transport that
commodity to its destination. Enron also uses derivatives, like
swaps, options, and forwards, to create contracts for third parties
and to hedge its exposure to credit risks and other variables. If you
thought Enron was just an energy company, have a look at its SEC
filings. In its 1999 annual report the company wrote that ""the use of
financial instruments by Enron's businesses may expose Enron to
market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity
and equity prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates.""

   Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating. ""It's very difficult
for us on Wall Street with as little information as we have,"" says
Fleischer, who is a big bull. (The same is true for Enron's
competitors, but ""wholesale operations"" are usually a smaller part of
their business, and they trade at far lower multiples.) ""Enron is a
big black box,"" gripes another analyst. Without having access to each
and every one of Enron's contracts and its minute-by-minute
activities, there isn't any way to independently answer critical
questions about the company. For instance, many Wall Streeters
believe that the current volatility in gas and power markets is
boosting Enron's profits, but there is no way to know for sure. ""The
ability to develop a somewhat predictable model of this business for
the future is mostly an exercise in futility,"" wrote Bear Stearns
analyst Robert Winters in a recent report.

   To some observers, Enron resembles a Wall Street firm. Indeed,
people commonly refer to the company as ""the Goldman Sachs of energy
trading."" That's meant as a compliment. But the fact that part of
Goldman's business is inherently risky and impenetrable to outsiders
is precisely the reason that Goldman, despite its powerful franchise,
trades at 17 times trailing earnings--or less than one-third of
Enron's P/E. And as Long Term Capital taught us, the best-laid
hedges, even those designed by geniuses, can go disastrously wrong.
""Trying to get a good grip on Enron's risk profile is challenging,""
says Shipman.

   Nor at the moment is Enron's profitability close to that of
brokerages (which, in fairness, do tend to be more leveraged). While
Wall Street firms routinely earn north of 20% returns on their equity-
-Goldman's ROE last year was 27%--Enron's rate for the 12 months
ended in September (the last period for which balance sheet
information is available) was 13%. Even less appealing is Enron's
return on invested capital (a measure including debt), which is
around 7%. That's about the same rate of return you get on far less
risky U.S. Treasuries.

   Enron vehemently disagrees with any characterization of its
business as black box-like. It also dismisses any comparison to a
securities firm. ""We are not a trading company,"" CFO Andrew Fastow
emphatically declares. In Enron's view, its core business--where the
company says it makes most of its money--is delivering a physical
commodity, something a Goldman Sachs doesn't do. And unlike a trading
firm, which thrives when prices are going wild, Enron says that
volatility has no effect on its profits--other than to increase
customers, who flock to the company in turbulent times. Both
Skilling, who describes Enron's wholesale business as ""very simple to
model,"" and Fastow note that the growth in Enron's profitability
tracks the growth in its volumes almost perfectly. ""People who raise
questions are people who have not gone through [our business] in
detail and who want to throw rocks at us,"" says Skilling. Indeed,
Enron dismisses criticism as ignorance or as sour grapes on the part
of analysts who failed to win its investment-banking business. The
company also blames short-sellers for talking down Enron. As for the
details about how it makes money, Enron says that's proprietary
information, sort of like Coca-Cola's secret formula. Fastow, who
points out that Enron has 1,217 trading ""books"" for different
commodities, says, ""We don't want anyone to know what's on those
books. We don't want to tell anyone where we're making money.""

   In addition to its commodities business, Enron has another
division called Assets and Investments that is every bit as
mysterious. This business involves building power plants around the
world, operating them, selling off pieces of them, ""invest[ing] in
debt and equity securities of energy and communications-related
business,"" as Enron's filings note, and other things.

   Actually, analysts don't seem to have a clue what's in Assets and
Investments or, more to the point, what sort of earnings it will
generate. Enron's results from that part of its business tend to be
quite volatile--profits fell from $325 million in the second quarter
of 1999 to $55 million in the second quarter of 2000. In written
reports, Morgan Stanley chalked up the decline to the poor
performance of Enron's ""significant number of investments"" in telecom
stocks; Dain Rauscher Wessels blamed it on a lack of asset sales.

   In any event, some analysts seem to like the fact that Enron has
some discretion over the results it reports in this area. In a
footnote to its 1999 financials, Enron notes that it booked ""pretax
gains from sales of merchant assets and investments totaling $756
million, $628 million, and $136 million"" in 1999, 1998, and 1997.
""This is an enormous earnings vehicle, which can often be called upon
when and if market conditions require,"" notes UBS Warburg analyst Ron
Barone. Not everyone is so chipper. ""We are concerned they are
liquidating their asset base and booking it as recurring revenue,
especially in Latin America,"" says analyst Andre Meade at Commerzbank-
-who has a hold rating on the stock. At the least, these sorts of
hard-to-predict earnings are usually assigned a lower multiple.

   There are other concerns: Despite the fact that Enron has been
talking about reducing its debt, in the first nine months of 2000 its
debt went up substantially. During this period, Enron issued a net
$3.9 billion in debt, bringing its total debt up to a net $13 billion
at the end of September and its debt-to-capital ratio up to 50%, vs.
39% at the end of 1999. Nor does Enron make life easy for those who
measure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations. In
1999 its cash flow from operations fell from $1.6 billion the
previous year to $1.2 billion. In the first nine months of 2000, the
company generated just $100 million in cash. (In fact, cash flow
would have been negative if not for the $410 million in tax breaks it
received from employees' exercising their options.)

   But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements is
misleading. The fact that Enron's cash flow this year was meager, at
least when compared with earnings, was partly a result of its
wholesale business. Accounting standards mandate that its assets and
liabilities from its wholesale business be ""marked to market""--
valued at their market price at a given moment in time. Changes in
the valuation are reported in earnings. But these earnings aren't
necessarily cash at the instant they are recorded. Skilling says that
Enron can convert these contracts to cash anytime it chooses by
""securitizing"" them, or selling them off to a financial institution.
Enron then receives a ""servicing fee,"" but Skilling says that all the
risks (for example, changes in the value of the assets and
liabilities) are then transferred to the buyer. That's why, he says,
Enron's cash flow will be up dramatically, while debt will be ""way
down, way down"" when the company publishes its full year-end results,
which are due out soon.

   That's good, because Enron will need plenty of cash to fund its
new, high-cost initiatives: namely, the high-cost buildout of its
broadband operations. In order to facilitate its plan to trade excess
bandwidth capacity, Enron is constructing its own network. This
requires big capital expenditures. So broadband had better be a good
business. Both Enron and some of the analysts who cover it think it
already is. Included in the $126 a share that Enron says it's worth
is $40 a share--or $35 billion--for broadband. Several of Enron's
analysts value broadband at $25 a share, or roughly $22 billion (and
congratulate themselves for being conservative). But $22 billion
seems like a high valuation for a business that reported $408 million
of revenues and $60 million of losses in 2000. Not all analysts are
so aggressive. ""Valuing the broadband business is an ""extremely
difficult, uncertain exercise at this point in time,"" notes Bear
Stearns' Winters, who thinks that broadband, while promising, is
worth some $5 a share today.

   Of course everything could go swimmingly. Enron has told analysts
that it plans to sell between $2 billion and $4 billion of assets
over the next 12 months. The bullish scenario for Enron is that the
proceeds from those sales will reduce debt, and as earnings from new
businesses kick in, the company's return on invested capital will
shoot upward. Along with broadband, Enron has ambitious plans to
create big businesses trading a huge number of other commodities,
from pulp and paper to data storage to advertising time and space.
Perhaps most promising is its Enron Energy Services business, which
manages all the energy needs of big commercial and industrial
companies. Skilling has told analysts that its new businesses will
generate a return on invested capital of about 25% over the long run.

   But all of these expectations are based on what Wolfe, the  J.P.
Morgan strategist, calls ""a little bit of the China syndrome""--in
other words, if you get x% of y enormous market, you'll get z in
revenues. For instance, Enron says the global market for broadband
and storage services will expand from $155 billion in 2001 to
somewhere around $383 billion in 2004. ""Even a modest market share
and thin margins provide excellent potential here,"" writes Ed
Tirello, a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown senior power strategist. The
problem, as we know from innumerable failed dot-coms, is that the y
enormous market doesn't always materialize on schedule. And Enron
isn't leaving itself a lot of room for the normal wobbles and
glitches that happen in any developing business.

   In the end, it boils down to a question of faith. ""Enron is no
black box,"" says Goldman's Fleischer. ""That's like calling Michael
Jordan a black box just because you don't know what he's going to
score every quarter."" Then again, Jordan never had to promise to hit
a certain number of shots in order to please investors.

Dear Ken:

Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he
give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might
prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in
Washington a week or so ago, she said that the ""Digital Divide"" was the 
hottest
topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so 
that
businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we
want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity
and platform in Washington!

Just thought I should give you ""heads-up"" in case he asks and please tell 
Linda
I said hello!

Thank you for doing so much for the cause!

1655,"Per our conversation, it appears that the two companies are going to merge in 
October?  Looking at Lotus Notes, I don't think we could pick two bigger dogs 
of masters to have in place.  I don't think we want either master to be the

Exchange Agreement and with Morgan we have a Master Energy Price Swap 
Agreement.  Yuk, yuk.  If I had my druthers I say, LET'S START OVER.  I know 
it's far reaching, but maybe we could make it our goal to have this master 
replaced by October.  Do you think that's do-able?  Do we have a contact at 
Chase/Morgan we can start dealing with?  I'm going to add chase to the

As per our discussion, I have done the following to fix the issues with Questar data:

-  dumped data from 02/04/2001 -> present, for all cycles
-  fixed the transform component to pull the proper column for utilized capacity and also to assign the correct effective date for each value
-  re-transformed and re-loaded ALL cycle 5 data (from the *htm files we have)

Now, in loading the 86 or so days back into the DB, approx. 3603 PRIMARY KEY violations were logged...this means that they are duplicating point data within the same day, same cycle, etc.  If this data could be examined more closely in the reports that are subsequently generated, we can make sure that things are truly copacetic from our side (a ""surface"" scan of the *.htm files shows that they are indeed duplicating points, usually with different names...the utilized capacity associated with these points is the same though, so this doesn't appear to be a big issue, except for the fact that we will continue to have primary key violations being logged).

As always, any questions, just ask.

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Mark/Tana,

Due to the recent organizational changes with Sheri Thomas & Amita Gosalia 
(see memo below), we will need to remove them as ""agents and 
attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on behalf of EOL"" and add 
Savita Puthigai, Lara McKinney and myself. 

Also, Dale Neuner should be removed as he is no longer part of EnronOnline 
operations but is responsible for DealBench and CommodityLogic operations. 
Savita suggested we also add Torrey Moorer since I will be out on maternity 
leave in mid July and he will be backing me up during that time. 

Can you let me know the turnaround time of a change like this?
Also, is it separate documentation for North America and Europe?

Thank you for your help.

1671,"If organizational changes that are announced together are expected to be 
bound together by a common theme, then this announcement may fall a bit 
short.  The continuing growth of the demands placed upon the Government 
Affairs organization has, however, necessitated certain modest organizational 
shifts and additions, many of which have already occurred or have been in 
transition for the last several weeks.  Rather than attempting to explain the 
rationale for each change in this memo, instead, I will briefly describe them 
(attached is a revised organizational chart and map), and offer to answer any 
questions anyone might have.

While Sue Nord will continue to report directly to me in the role of policy 
development and coordination, she has been and will be spending a 
considerable amount of her time on broadband and communications issues and 
will also report to Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere in that capacity.
Steve Montovano will assume responsibility for an additional six southeastern 
states, including responsibility for SERC.  Marchris Robinson and Tom 
Chapman, who has agreed to join the group on a more permanent basis as a 
Senior Regulatory Specialist, will report to Steve.  Ron McNamara has also 
joined Steve,s group and will focus on the tight power pools in the Northeast 
U.S.
Janine Migden will assume responsibility for the states of Tennessee, 
Arkansas, and Louisiana as well as issues related to TVA.  Bill Moore will 
now report to Janine.
In order to assure more intraregional coordination in the West, Mary Hain, 
who supports ENA,s trading desk in Portland, now reports to Paul Kaufman.
With Kathleen Magruder,s recent departure to ResCo, we are actively searching 
for an individual to direct our efforts in Texas and Oklahoma as well as our 
efforts at ERCOT and the Southeast Power Pool.
Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere have each done an outstanding job supporting 
Enron Broadband Services throughout the world these past months and will 
share responsibility for directing those efforts in the Americas.  They will 
also assume responsibility within the group for Enron,s E-Commerce efforts in 
the Americas.  In addition to Sue Nord, the group will consist of Tracy 
McLaughlin, who supports Scott in Portland, Xi Xi, an analyst who joined us 
early this year in Houston and Lara Leibman who has just joined the group.  
Lara will also continue her activities relative to the Department of Justice 
and the Federal Trade Commission.
Ricardo Charvel, in addition to his responsibilities in Mexico, will assume 
overall responsibility for Central America, the Caribbean Basin as well as 
Columbia and Venezuela.  Reporting to Ricardo are Alberto Levy, who is 
primarily responsible for Venezuela and Columbia and Vinio Floris, who 
recently joined us from Azurix, who will be primarily responsible for Central 
America and the Caribbean Basin.
Tom Delaney will now report to Jeff Brown and will support him in our 
continuing efforts to bring additional reform and standardization to 
wholesale power markets in the U.S.  Damon Harvey has also joined Jeff,s 
group as an analyst.
Gloria Ogenyi, Thane Twiggs and Robert Neustaedter have all joined Harry 
Kingerski,s group to enhance that group,s ability to provide rates and other 
regulatory services throughout the Americas.
With Tom Reichelderfer,s departure, Susan Covino will be the sole coordinator 
for the government affairs group,s contractual relationship with ResCo.  
Susan will also begin to get involved in other projects over the next several 
weeks.
The Federal Government Affairs group organization will have a flatter 
organizational structure with each individual in the group reporting directly 
to Joe Hillings.  Functional assignments, which are reflected on one of the 
attachments, have also been made in this group to bring additional focus to 
their efforts, with an increased emphasis on issues related to our energy, 
broadband services and e-commerce-based business activities and a refocusing 
of the group,s efforts in support of commercial groups globally to better 
align them with the near and mid-term objectives of the regional commercial 
groups throughout the world.   On a separate note, Tom Briggs will be joining 
the Federal Government Affairs group in Washington early this summer.  We are 
pleased to have Tom, who has most recently been in London in the Enron Europe 
Government Affairs group, join the Federal Government Affairs team.

Please join me in welcoming, congratulating, and wishing well the individuals 
noted in this memo. 

 One final thought.  As we are quickly approaching the mid-point of the year 
2000, we must stay constantly  focused on our overall group objectives for 
the year as well as on our respective regional group objectives (see attached 
'Top 10' objectives for U.S. & Canada).  With that said, the hard work and 
dedication of so many individuals in the group does not go unnoticed.  As the 
group has grown, it has become increasingly difficult for me to visit the 
regions as frequently as I once did and to spend as much time on an 
individual basis with many of you.  My respect, gratitude and affection for 
the people in this group only grows, however, with time.  Our collective 
task, while both challenging and intellectually stimulating, is also quite 
daunting with both ever growing burdens and opportunities as the company 
continues to grow and prosper.  We must continue to work hard to meet our 
objectives, but we must also find a way to keep our work and jobs in their 
proper perspective and to have fun during the journey.  Whatever I can do to 
help meet those objectives I will do, and, of course, am always open to 
suggestions in that regard.  

Thank you

Hi guys,

We're launching (new) Bankruptcy Swaps and brand new Credit Default Swaps on 
Monday.

As usual there are 'special' rules that surround these products.  I'm in the 
process of setting all the Guest Profiles to reflect these rules but wanted 
to pass the information on for PAs that we receive.  
Houston- can you please forward to your appropriate Legal teams?  if they 
have specific questions regarding these products or the legal framework 
surrounding them, please refer them to Denis O'Connell, the London lawyer who 
has worked on the GTCs etc.

 Credit Default Swaps
You have to be a special kind of counterparty to trade these products (please 
see Denis for required documentation needed) and they are taking a very 
targeted marketing approach to their customers.  Because of this (for now) 
only US and UK counterparties can have View access.

Bankruptcy Swaps - we used to have 5 product types for Bankruptcy Swaps (Nor, 
UK, US, SE, FI) but these have been consolidated under new terms into 1 
(Global) Bankruptcy Swap.  The other 5 product types will be moved to 
Inactive as they have never traded.

Also, a new Web Filter will be used to pull in the new Bankruptcy and Credit 
Default Swaps - Global Credit Instruments.  Please advise any customers to 
use this web filter to view the products (provided they are in a country who

Subject: Access Rights

Hi Denis,

I'm trying to figure out what the 'Rules' are for the Bankruptcy and Credit 
Default Swaps go as far as Guest Access to EnronOnline.

Based upon your profile spreadsheet from Wednesday, here's what it looks 
like.  Please let me know if there are any differences as I will be 
communicating these rules to the London and Houston Product Control Groups.  

Also, can you please tell me which countries Could and Could Not trade the 
two products (with proper certification in place of course).  As discussed 
earlier this week, I believe you will be communicating this to the Houston 
Legal team directly... so I'm just asking as an fyi.

Thanks,
Lara

In the table below - 'N' means the country can Not View the products, 'R' 
means the country can View the products




Also can you please tell me what the rules are for the following countries 
for both Bankruptcy and CDS:
Per Denis O'Connell, none of the below Countries can have VIEW access to 
either CDS or Bankruptcy Swaps

Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process

Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.

In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark 
Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.

With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.

Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.

If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.

Thanks

You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahead DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART offpeak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day.

Hi Sean,

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. If I understand correctly the only difference between day ahead and the DART product is that it does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. Also a DART trade for the 3rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the 3rd?

Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how the Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like real-time is a success, so let's get going with this.  

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on real-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a ""US Pwr Phy Firm  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART""  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the party selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each hour.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I would be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transaction.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow such that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions that needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following language to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal review).

""This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delivery on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-time means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consistent with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices.""

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

Kevin

A US Power Transaction with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. under which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase a quantity of firm energy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price. The Contract Price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Web Site.  ""Firm energy"" is power that is or will be scheduled as firm energy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council for which the only excuses for failure to deliver or receive are if an interruption is (i) due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agreement; or (ii) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the underlying agreement between the Seller and the Buyer that governs this transaction (the ""Agreement""), if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in the applicable cover remedy section(s) of the Agreement.  ""WSPP Agreement"" means the Western System Power Pool Agreement as amended from time to time.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery or receipt of power at Mid Columbia.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').
The transaction is for on-peak (""Peak"") hours on each Delivery Day beginning with the hour ending 0700 (6:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2200 (10:00 pm) Pacific Prevailing Time.  ""Delivery Day"" means a day during the term of the transaction that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday, excluding any day that is a NERC holiday.

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

1695,"We are approaching February 29, 2000, which is generally regarded as the 
second most critical Year 2000 rollover date, second only to the millennium 
rollover.  A year divisible by 100 is not a leap year, unless it is divisible 
by 400.  As a consequence, some applications that were programmed incorrectly 
will believe the date is March 1, which may cause system errors.

During the millennium rollover Enron encountered Y2K related issues only with 
the bottom tier of applications and embedded systems that were ranked as 
""ordinary"" or ""low"" in our triage processes.  The problems that did arise 
were few and were quickly fixed.  This is exactly what we were planning for 
and is a testament to a job done exceptionally well by all.  

In consideration of the few and minor problems Enron encountered on January 
1, 2000, our procedures for the 29th will be curtailed.  The goals for this 
period are to validate that all mission critical applications and embedded 
systems are functioning normally and to ensure that all problems are reported 
through the project office.  We are not planning to reopen the Millennium 
Management Center nor do we plan to operate outside of normal business hours.

Please ensure that each group that reported to you for the millennium 
rollover run through the same Y2K checklists for critical systems.  For this 
exercise, however, we anticipate them reporting back to you on an exception 
basis only.

If problems do occur, the nature, details and planned ready dates should be 
forwarded to Andrew Parsons (713 853-6665) or Bob Johansen (713 853-6842), 
who will report to management and monitor events.  Also, be sure to route any 
inquiries from the press through the same public relations contacts that were 
used on January 1st.  The key contact at Corp Public Relations is Karen Denne 
(713 853-9757).

Thank you for your cooperation,

LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  ""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind,"" he said. ""The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators.""

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a ""blind pig could
make money"" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  ""It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it,"" Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP ""an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers.""

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

1701,"Late tonight, the Barton Subcommittee passed an energy policy package 
(without any electricity provisions other than those related to conservation) 
on a bipartisan vote of 29-1.  The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs. 
Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable 
energy projects.

During consideration of the bill, several amendments of interest and concern 
to Enron were offered and withdrawn; they are likely to be offered when the 
full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday 
and Wednesday.  The amendments in this category are:

1. Mr. Waxman has an amendment he called the ""blackout and price gouging 
prevention amendment"" that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price 
mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose cost-of-service based 
rates (with a rate of return of 15 percent) if an entity is found to be 
withholding power from the grid during an emergency.  The cost-of-service 
rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entity's sales in the 
Western U.S.  Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when 
it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it 
until full committee.  We will continue those efforts before the full 
committee vote.

2. Mr. Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote 
wind in Iowa and other renewables (he may wait until an electricity bill 
rather than full committee on this bill).

3. Mr. Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the 
requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places.  He said that 
currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC 
approved.

4. Mr. Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop 
and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a 
UN agreement that President George Bush (""41"") agreed to in 1992 (reducing 
these emissions to 1990 levels).

Chairman Barton indicated that the Subcommittee will take up an electric 
restructuring bill either later this month or early in September, depending 
on how long it takes to process this first energy package in the full 
committee and in the full House.

Hi Steve and Jeff -

This was a cold call to Ken that Vanessa took while we were in Exec. Comm. 
meeting.  She had asked Ginger who to refer him to as it was CA. and she 
mentioned Jeff.  Please only call if there is any interest.

It was not mentioned to me.  I'm copying rosie and vanessa to find out if 
this was a simple referral (in which case you should keep the work to a 
minimum -- return the call, but don't get distracted from your other efforts) 
or whether Ken is especially interested in this and wants us to follow 
through.

Just got a call from a fellow named Jame Edgerly at the Enterprise Zone, 
Inc.  He told me that Ken Lay (through Ken's secretary Vanessa) referred me 
to him.  He is very interested in getting us to help him work with the 
Legislature to establish an ""Enterprise Zone"" energy tariff to encourage 
investment in California's Enterprice Zones.  Before I launch on the effort, 
just wanted to check in and see if this rings a bell with you.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

1707,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Please scrub the prompt tab, phys index tab, fin index tab, and consolidated tab.  Make sure they all tie out to the hedge strips and sitara.  Shannon will give you a copy of my physical volumes from sitara.  We will go over it tomorrow.

Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5 hours
because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject is
he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating just
about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam, especially
to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell her
or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address because she
had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a chance
to.

Smooches

Hey Lady,

I just asked ""Tarsha"" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been
shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing
great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm
very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little ""stinky"".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll
call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs

   Hey Tricey!

   I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been
   going
   on? How are the boys?

   Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
   yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

   Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday
   but
   she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
   Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to
   you.
   Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer
   at
   4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
   address I have one for her too?

The Atlantic ridge will prevail? for now.  A series of weather systems will move into the West Coast and head East through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. While the pattern will be more active than recent weeks, no one big storm is likely to bring travel problems on a large scale. In addition, there is little additional cold air available to spin up a Winter Storm, so most precip will be in the form of light to moderate rain. Exceptions to this will be the mountains of the West where ski resort snows will fall. Also, the far Northern reaches of the U.S. could see some light snows. Temperature departures are expected to go largely above normal again with the highest numbers in the North, though not to the de! gree of earlier in the month. Negative numbers though not significant are confined to the West where storms come in off the ocean and in the Southeast where this time of year is not cold anyway.

I suspect surface pressures are a little overdone given the upper level flow. However, the Gulf will be open and some significant moisture and wind are possible. The storm track will be well North which confines snow to the Northern U.S. Significant winter weather though from Wyoming to Minnesota is possible. The large scale pattern ending November will be for a trough to sit in the Interior West while a strong ridge exists over the Southeast.  There is still plenty of arctic air available in Canada, but with the jet stream in a broad West to SW flow, no means of delivery appear available until at least December 1'st. In a general sense, I look for temperatures to be below normal in the West with above normal in the South and East. The North! is somewhat a question mark being closer to the arctic air and could go either way. I'll lean to normal for now.  Day 6: Monday, November 26, 2001   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

One way to proceed could be  that I try to have an informal chat with Mr.
Barozzi ( Head of Strategic Planning ) to see if they are interested to
talk, if the answer is Yes probably have them sign a confidentiality and
then either meet them with you or your people or send them information,
whatever you think makes more sense to begin with .


open for any suggestion .

Stan + Mark,

as you are probably aware Enel is actively looking at acquiring water
businesses, particularly, but not only, in the UK .

They are also generally interested in opportunities in South America .

We are always looking at things that could attract Enel' s interest in
order to help us get our hands on some power and potentially gas positions
in Italy .

Moreover, Enel is cash rich and has proven to be a very generous buyer,
when it comes to acquisitions in areas of business ( gas, water and
telecoms ) that can help them to fulfil their vision to become  a multi
utility .

 I have got some decent contacts at the decision making level . Would you
be interested in discussing a potential approach ?

1714,"I just saw a note that you'll speak to us -- the Washington office -- later this morning.  Quite independent from that, I actually wrote this email in my head last night as I experienced yet another sleepless early morning ...

You know this intuitively, I suspect, but I just wanted to underscore that the staff here in DC have experienced a rather stressful period.  First was the 11th, when several of us (Linda, John, Pat, Chris, Allison, Jeff Keeler and I) were all up on the Hill -- literally each of us was within a hundred yards of the Capitol building.  Our phones began ringing as wives and colleagues told us to quickly walk as far away from the Hill as we could since there were reports of more planes in the air.

Then yesterday we all piled into the ER for anthrax testing since we've been up on the Hill in the last few days.  A very long shot on that score, since none of us was in the Hart building on Monday, for cause for concern nonetheless.

I look around me and see small but discernible signs of stress.  I know I experience them at home at night.

But I just wanted to pass this on.  We're doing our jobs, but somehow it just happens that we inadvertently stumble into harm's way at precisely those moments -- when we're doing our jobs!

I grew up overseas, son of diplomats.  We we were in a country for only two years, not the usual three or four year tour -- and when we saw strained families and marriages, and increased alcohol consumption and other ways of dealing with stress ... it was simply because we lived in what they call ""hardship posts.""  The government understood that, and kept a special watch on you on those countries.  

So, from this hardship post ...  hope this isn't out of line, but wanted to pass on my thoughts directly to you.  Maybe tonight I'll get a full night's sleep now.

Best,
Steve

1717,"Brent -

I have attached both the Williams and Bank of America amendment forms for you to take a look at when you have a chance.  It is interesting to note that the Williams schedule skips Part 5 and contains the general provisions in Part 4.   Also, with the BofA document, there were some terms in Part 5(h) that looked to have been negotiated terms.  These have basically been incorporated into the Amendment so that the integrity of the agreement remains intact.

Please take a look at the attached is necessary.  I have both files in my office if you should need them.

Thanks.

(i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought 
they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the 
commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual 
matter.  I agree about Tana.

Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process

Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.

In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark 
Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.

With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.

Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.

If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.

Thanks

Greg

1727,"I assume that what this e-mail relates to is the discussed ""transfer"" of the 
2 LDC swaps from Raptor 2 to Raptor 4. Frankly, I do not know what it means 
to assign a swap from 1 of these vehicles to another vehicle. I think that in 
general the schedules to the ISDAs that each of the 2 sets of parties 
executed are the same, but what happens in the case of differences? My rather 
simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and 
execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4. 

Unless anyone objects, I propose that we proceed along the lines outlined 
above, using the Raptor process documentation developed by Lisa and recently 
updated by Gordon.

We recently [like yesterday] received closing books on Raptor 3 and 
distributed those. If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures, 
let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned 
merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats 
movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?]

No.  I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving 
and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the 
correct parties etc.  Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted 
for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of 
inapplicable specifics) .    We ought to also check with Joel about any 
provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment.  
I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE 
under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be 
clean from the ISDA point of view.  Mary

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in 
doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.  I feel like it's been a 
while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed 
the interaction.  It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the 
worlds problems over cold Shiner and I think the world may be the worse for 
it.  So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of 
eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.  If it looks like 'a go', 
I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.

The one and only,

Subject: where does our energy come from?


Assemblyman Bill Leonard's most recent e-newsletter contained the
following information.  I think it is very interesting to consider in
light of the present energy situation in California and the comments of
our present Governor.

Regards,
Curt

---------------------------------------------


***Who Really Powers California?***
Governor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling,
cattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy
crisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the
Governor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers
may
be interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The
following list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each
group of
generators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded
up
resulting in slightly more than 100%)

18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California)
15%- Southern California Edison (California)
11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada)
10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California)
10%- Imported power from the Southwest
7%- State and Federal Agencies
6%- AES power company
5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts
5%- Reliant power company
4%- Duke power company
4%- Southern power company
4%- Dynegy power company
1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California)
1%- Calpine power company
1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)
 
It should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from
Texas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's
energy
portfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's
AES,
and North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy
portfolio.

This list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every
provider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to
identify those power producers who used market power to ring up high
profits
on Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our
investigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power
companies,
utilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts
could
all be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those
companies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a
misrepresentation of fact.

Subject: Brigham

We have completed the sale of our Brigham investment for $20.0 million 
(JEDI/ENA).  ENA's net share of the proceeds for $12.5 million.   The 
transaction has been closed and funded and at the book/raptor value.

My metaphor for pulling together liquidation transactions of severely 
distressed assets like Brigham is trying to shield a pencil balanced on its 
point in the midst of a hurricane.  In the case of the Brigham deal the 
hurricane was a Force Five.

Jempy Neyman, who led the transaction, and Brandi Morris, a senior specialist 
in Special Assets, did an outstanding job getting this tough deal done.

The next ""balanced pencil"" is closing the Basic Energy (Sierra Well Service) 
sale by mid-November.  We're on track:  so far, the hurricane has not  blown 
the pencil away.

the Buy Side Direct agreements:

Buy Side Direct Agreement:

Notice - Sara is developing proposed guidelines for notification (how + who 
should receive).

Indemnity (#6) - Jason and Sara will discuss.  

I would encourage you to discuss these issues without me unless you prefer 
that I participate.   

Weiss, Peck & Greer Agreement:

Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest that 
section 9 state this, or be removed.  

Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions through Buy 
Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.  WPG would only request 
margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.  

Mike Minnich noted that WPG had agreed to our other comments.  Have we 
received a revised WPG agreement with these changes ?

As noted below, I have asked Sheila to provide information required for the 
BSD and WPG agreements.  

Please let me know if there are other issues which I should be involved in 
discussing.

I apologize for the delay.  I made the changes as discussed except:

1.  I did not put a limit on the Clearly erroneous policy--not because I
didn't agree, but because I did not see an obvious answer in the Nasdaq
agreement.  I will look at it more tomorrow, but I wanted to get this to you
rather than delay further.
2.  Striking first sentence in 5.4--I have not heard back from our lawyers.
Hopefully tomorrow.

Also, I attach the broker dealer attachment 2 which you said you didn't
have.

I think we resolved most of your WPG questions.  WPG is OK with all of your
changes except Insert 6.  I will try to get further resolution as to why
they object so that you can negotiate further if you like.

If all goes well, hopefully this can be wrapped up tomorrow.

Mike

1750,"Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and ""Hot Button"" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

The yen soared Monday morning on the back of a 5.9% rise in the Nikkei to a 6-month high of 11,450. The rally caught many investors by surprise and added to Friday's corrective gains in JPY. The Bank of Japan also said that it flooded Japan's monetary base by 27.5% y/y in February, the largest rise since the oil crisis of 1974. While this move was welcomed by the stock market, traditional economics teaches that is a negative for the yen. But, in the run up to March 31 fiscal year-end, the government's attempts to sustain a floor under Japanese share prices will have a restrictive effect on foreigners selling of Japanese shares over the coming weeks.   Last week saw another strong sell off in USD/JPY after being rejected around 135.00. USD/JPY broke trendline support around 133.50 on Thursday and has yet to recover. Now, a break of key support at 132.00/131.80 seen as bearish implication for the pair and would open up a downside target of 130.45. But downward momentum is expected to bottom today, which could lend support to the pair above the key 132.00/131.80 area. Upside capped at 133.0, 133.50 and 133.70, 134.00/10, 134.70/85 and strong resistance at 135.15. Support holds at 132.20 and 131.80.  Adding to yen strength was this weekend's failure of construction contractor, Sato Kogyo, which has been taken as a positive sign that non-performing loans are at last starting to be tackled. But, today's rally was mostly the result of the government's short-sighted policy to reduce stock market manipulation and urge domestic pension funds to buy along with adding funds to the stock buy-back scheme.  This, the government hopes, will avoid a financial crisis ahead of fiscal year end. If it keeps the Nikkei at or above 10,000, it would avoid the need for an infusion of taxpayers' money to help rid banks of non-performing loans. The government dislikes the idea of another public injection, as it would amount to an admonition of failure and be politically unappealing. But putting an artificial floor under Japanese share prices is likely to prove short-lived as dealers expect any gains to give way to a new wave of selling in the new fiscal year in April, which would lead back to yen weakness.  Moreover, with repatriation poised to slow near the end of March and net outward investment to resume thereafter dealers expect to see further yen weakness in the weeks to come allowing USD/JPY to target 140 once the 135.00/20 major resistance band is broken.   EUR/USD was unchanged after a better than expected rise in consumer confidence data which the European Commission said confirmed its forecast that the economic recovery in the Eurozone would begin in the first quarter of 2002. But the slight increase in consumer confidence to minus 9 from minus 11 only translated into a meager 0.2 rise in the overall economic sentiment survey to 99.2 in February from 99.0. Weighing on the whole was business sentiment which did not change at minus 14, disappointing the consensus estimate of an improvement to minus 11.9.  EUR/USD gave up earlier gains and fell back towards last week's 3-week low of 86.25. Traders were not encouraged by Eurozone prospects and sentiment is again turning bearish enough to target a move through 86.30/15 on its way to its 6-month low of 85.63. Support is seen at 86.30, 86.15, and 85.60. Resistance is viewed at 86.60, 87.10, and 87.85.  Meanwhile, the focus this week will be the BoE and ECB which both meet on Thursday this week. Stronger than expected E12 PMI data last week and a further gain in consumer confidence are likely to reinforce the ECB's resolve to keeps rates unchanged this week.  The BoE is also likely to keep rates unchanged after UK February manufacturing PMI rose unexpectedly above the 50-mark last Friday indicating manufacturing has recovered from yearlong contraction. However, sterling is likely to remain weakened by EMU expectations, and because of the fact that BoE Governor George again tried to talk down the sterling strength. Moreover, the strong performance of US stocks on Friday is likely to underpin USD as investors switch back into risk seeking mode. European majors should suffer from this shift as the Swiss franc loses its safe haven luster and sterling loses investors seeking safety in the FTSE.    GBP/USD tried to add to Friday's recovery from a 3-week low of 1.4110 but only reached a high of 1.4218, lower than Friday's high of 1.4230. Cable subsequently fell back to a day's low of 1.4159, just above support seen at 1.4150. Resistance eyed at 1.4180 and 1.4230. A break of 1.4110 would put 1.4045 under pressure and be seen as a bearish signal.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Just to be sure you're in the loop here, no one in Finance was available to sign this DASH last week. Not Fastow, not Glisan, their Assistants weren't in. Deffner wasn't here. Lipshutz wasn't here. etc, etc, etc. I told Hatchen, Gorte to represent Corp. Finance and Gorte gave verbal OK. We still haven't been able to get Fastow and Glisan to sign the DASH (I think they're back tomorrow). Deal is done and executed.

This is too difficult for someone in our Deal Management group to facilitate through our system. Maybe we need to give back-up authority to RAC for approvals in a situation like this. This may be a topic for our offsite on Friday.

Chris,

Pam at the City of Tallahassee sent me her volume reports for February 2002.
There are two adjustments that will be made to their invoice.

The base volume will be increased from 100,000 dth to 104,793 dth.
This will increase our supply with Dominion which I believe you have been informed
by Dominion as well.
The Swing gas for 2/27/02 will be reduced by 450 to 1,550 due to an operational scheduling cut
from the Reliant pool.  The City of Tallahassee has already deducted this from their payment on
the original invoice.  In summary, I will be preparing an additional invoice to the City of Tallahassee
in the amount of $14,570.72.  I will let you know when payment is received on this adjustment.

Don't forget my State of Florida adjustments!

Thanks,
Max

1768,"Enron, as a pacesetter company, is preparing for the annual United Way 
campaign. The official kick-off is Wednesday, August 9th and Enron is hard at 
work preparing for this event.  In 1999, Enron achieved a 17% increase in 
contributions compared to 1998 and for the 10th consecutive year we were one 
of Houston,s largest contributors.  With your help, we can continue this 
trend and achieve our Enron-wide goal for 2000 of $2,310,000.

We are poised to play a significant role in this year's campaign.  I am 
asking that the head of each business unit nominate one or more individuals 
from their department to serve as ""United Way Cheerleaders"" (aka ENA UW 
Campaigners).  Please provide one person for every 20 employees in your 
business unit.   These volunteers will help ENA,s United Way coordinators 
promote and educate employees about the United Way and Enron's campaign. 

Last year Enron's company-wide participation level was 78%. Several business 
units had 100% participation. However, ENA had the worst rate at 56%.  
Needless to say, this is not the position we want to be in at the end of this 
year,s campaign and the campaigners you appoint are vital to improving our 
performance. 

I realize everyone has a busy schedule, but this is an important cause and 
Enron is the recognized champion in the Houston area for our efforts. 

The following individuals, who can answer any questions you may have, are 
leading the ENA Campaign:

Kathie Grabstald, ext. 3-9610
Michelle Vitrella, ext. 3-9767
Kim Hillis, ext. 3-0681
Jennifer Burns, ext. 3-9440

Once you've selected your department's campaigners, please forward their 
names to Kathie, who will coordinate directly with them concerning the 
responsibilities of a Campaigner and provide support throughout the campaign.

All campaigners must attend a short training session within the next week, so 
we need your department,s names no later than August 2 at 9:00AM.

Additional Note for Executives (VP & above and those making more than 
$10,000/mo):

* Executive solicitation began July 24.
* Contribution commitments must be received via the on-line system by August 
9.
* Executive Breakfasts, sponsored by Jeff Skilling & Joe Sutton will be held 
August 3 and 4 at DePelchin Children's Center. Please plan to attend one of 
them.

If you have any questions, please call me or one of our Campaign 
Coordinators. Thank you in advance for your help and support in these 
efforts.

We finally agreed on the guaranty form (the cap is $25 million) and are about 
ready to execute the actual agreement.  I have one question:  in the ISDA 
world, we use ""cost of funds plus 1%"" as the default interest rate.  The Bear 
document provides:

""...interest thereon at a rate equal to (A) in the case of purchases of 
Foreign Securities, LIBOR, (B) in the case of purchases of any other 
securities (or other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder), the Federal 
Funds Rate or (C) such other rate as may be specified in Schedule B, in each 
case as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the date of such purchase 
until the date of payment of such excess.""

What is your preference:  Bear's standard language or do you want to specify 
another rate?

David, 
Here is our efficiency analysis from the online model.  This is just for the Bisti to Gallup section. The other sections have comparable results.
You can see that before the pigging the average efficiency were at 1.005 and after the pigging it rose to 1.04. Thus, a 4% increase in efficiency. However I see a gradual decreasing trend towards 1.035 just less than a week after the pigging.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

As of the 6th TW and NNG are balanced, I agree with Gary we need to stay balanced.

Crude Oil Futures Rise as Economy Brightens


    Crude oil futures for April delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.45 to 
$21.74 per barrel yesterday as the government released figures 
showing that the economy grew by 1.4% in the last quarter of 2001. 
The upward revision reinforced Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's 
contention that the recession was ending and supported recent signs 
that fuel demand is picking up steam. In the past month, gasoline 
demand has grown 2.5% from a year ago, averaging 8.4 million bpd, 
helped out by increased sales of SUVs, warmer than usual winter 
temperatures and lower retail prices. Recently, total fuel demand has 
been about 2% below last year, after remaining about 4% below for 
most of the winter due to unseasonably warm temperatures, which 
lowered heating oil demand, and a sharp drop in airline flights after 
September 11th. An agreement between OPEC and other producing nations 
to trim output by almost 2 million bpd appear to be finally taking 
hold. Refiners have also cut runs because of poor profit margins, 
which could add to the total oil in inventories but lowers products 
supply. According to EIA data, oil inventories dropped by 1 million 
barrels, or 0.6%, last week, marking the 2nd consecutive week 
supplies have fallen. Heating oil futures for March delivery rose 
$0.0089 to $0.5628 per gallon in pre-expiry trading. April heating 
oil futures gained $0.017 to $0.5715 per gallon. Gasoline futures for 
March delivery on the NYMEX, which also expired yesterday, lost 
$0.003 to $0.581 per gallon. April gasoline futures climbed $0.0135 
$0.6778 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures on the IPE was 
up $0.48 to $21.33 per barrel.

OPEC Production to Stay Unchanged

    OPEC is will not to adjust production in its March meeting, 
according to its secretary general. OPEC expects oil prices to remain 
at current levels through the first half of this year. The cartel cut 
its production by 1.5 million bpd in January in an effort to bolster 
prices. OPEC may consider adjusting production at its September 
meeting or call an emergency meeting before then if necessary. Prices 
have rallied recently amid rumors of a possible attack on Iraq and 
expectations of a decline in inventories.

    Kinder Morgan shares fell over 11% yesterday, down $5.20 to 
$41.00 per share, and shares of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners dropped

Canadian Producers Receive C$85 Million to Drop Oil Sands Dispute 


    A group of seven Canadian producers will receive C$85 million 
from the Alberta government to end a dispute that threatened to block 
further development of Alberta's massive northern oil sands. The 
agreement with the government and Conoco will settle a complex 
dispute that has dragged on for years. Conoco became involved after 
buying Gulf Canada last year. The companies claimed they were 
deprived of their rights after provincial regulators told them in 
1999 to shutdown about 150 natural gas wells located at Surmont, near 
Fort McMurray. The wells produced natural gas from reservoirs 
overlying the oil sands deposits. The regulators ruled gas production 
would deplete underground pressures, jeopardizing plans by Gulf 
Canada to develop a C$1.3 billion oil sands project. Alberta has 
decided not to pay compensation to the producers which claim C$200 
million annually in lost revenues. Alberta's oil sands, with total 
reserves of 300 billion barrels, are expected to attract at least 
C$25 billion in spending as energy companies proceed with numerous 
projects.

Marathon Holds First Investor Meeting

    At its first investor meeting since its split from US Steel, 
Marathon Oil revealed plans for 2 natural gas projects, a North Sea 
natural gas pipeline and a LNG facility in Mexico. The LNG facility 
would have the capacity to convert 750 MMcf per day of LNG back into 
natural gas to be sold in Mexico and California. Marathon could face 
some stiff competition as there are more than a dozen plans to build 
LNG facilities in or near the US. The project which includes a LNG 
terminal, pipelines and a power plant could start up in 2005. The 
other project is a North Sea pipeline, with a 900 MMcf per day 
capacity, that would run 675 kilometers to a terminal in England. 
Marathon and US Steel traded under a tracking stock structure over 
the last 10 years or so, which restricted the performance of 
Marathons stock. In the past few years, Marathon has been revamping 
its exploration and production business, which was having trouble 
replacing it oil and natural gas reserves. Marathon has cut nearly 
25% of the jobs in its exploration and production unit since 1999 and 
sold most of its Canadian oil assets. It is now focusing on projects 
in Russia, North America, North Africa, Indonesia and the North Sea. 
Marathon was also awarded a stake in one of Saudi Arabia's highly 
valued natural gas projects and has a strong refining and marketing 
partnership with Ashland. In January, Marathon reported a 4th quarter 
loss of $898 million and has about $900 million of debt from the 
breakup with US Steel.

Oil Shares Climb on Rating Upgrade


    Shares of oil companies traded mostly higher yesterday after 
Deutsche Banc Alex Brown upgraded its rating on integrated oil 
companies, citing better prospects for prices ahead. The integrated 
oil group was upgraded to `overweight' from `neutral'. Despite the 
near-term risks to prices and equities, the fundamentals are 
improving, eroding the fear of a price war. As a result, the oil 
price forecast has been increased by $1 to $20.50 per barrel for 
2002. It also upgraded ExxonMobil to `buy' from `market perform' and 
raised its price target on its stock to $46 from $41 to reflect an 
improved outlook for earnings, returns, upstream volume growth and 
the potential for significant multiple expansion during 2002.

BP to End Political Donations 

  
    BP, which operates in over 90 countries, says that as a global 
policy from now on it will make no political contributions from 
corporate funds anywhere in the world. The move comes as US lawmakers 
consider restrictions on corporate donations to politicians and 
political parties. The downfall of Enron has added pressure to revamp 
political campaign finance laws. Enron donated about $6 million to 
politicians since 1989 and had close ties to a range of lawmakers and 
government officials. BP says that it will engage in policy debate, 
stating its views and encouraging the development of ideas, but it 
will not fund any political activity or any political party. BP 
conducts about 40% of its business in the US and is one of the 
largest foreign firms operating in the nation. Most of BP's $840,000 
in US political donations made last year were tied to Amoco and Arco, 
which are now merged with BP. At a federal level, BP's $250,000 of 
donations were split about 60-40 in favor of Republicans, while the 
$590,000 donated at state level was split about 60-40 in favor 
Democrats. In the US, BP has received criticism from environmental 
groups opposed to drilling in protected areas in Alaska. Outside the 
US it has been targeted by human rights groups for its relationships 
with Chinese firms.

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.

Don't Miss the Playoffs Because You Missed a Player Update 

Nothing is more frustrating than having the wrong players in your lineup because you didn't have the latest news. Timely information is especially crucial now, when a loss can cost you a playoff spot. Go to Options, Notifications and check the box next to Player Updates - My Player to receive e-mail notification every time we report news about one of your players. Check the wireless box and we'll send a text message to your cell phone or pager. 

  _____  

How Does Your Team Stack Up? 

In head-to-head leagues, the Standings, Breakdown page shows your team's record versus each team in your league. If your league uses head-to-head record to break ties in the standings, this is the place to see how you stack up with your close competitors. The All column shows what your record would be against each team if you had played that team every week this season.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Dennis Taylor, Columbus, OH 

I have both Brian Griese and Tim Couch. Who should I start in Week 12? 

Answer - GG 

It's tough to bench Griese, but this is one week where you should consider it. Griese will likely be without wide receivers Rod Smith and Keith Poole, which leaves him to throw to Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole, two very inexperienced players. Denver will likely run the ball quite a bit against Miami as a result, which will limit Griese's productivity. Couch may not be the most reliable QB, but he does face a porous Tennessee secondary. Unless Smith is able to go for Denver, we'd have to side with Couch this week. 


Question - Rev. Mark A. Young 

Who would you recommend starting this week: Tom Brady, Brian Griese or Doug Flutie? Or should I pick up Kordell Stewart, Mark Brunell or Alex Van Pelt and start one of them? 

Answer - GG 

Considering the quarterback depth that your league obviously has, we'd suggest picking up Van Pelt this week. Griese may be without his starting receivers and Brady faces a tough Jets secondary. Flutie has a good matchup against Seattle, but he's been inconsistent. Van Pelt has an excellent grasp of Buffalo's West Coast offense, and he's facing a San Francisco unit that has been vulnerable to the pass all year. We'd hold onto both Griese and Brady, and suggest dropping Flutie for Van Pelt. 


Question - Paul Hershey, Corning, NY 

I've got a big showdown for first place in my league this week. I need to start three WRs out of these four: Cris Carter, Joe Horn, Marty Booker and Curtis Conway. Which three would you choose? 

Answer - GG 

When you're in a must-win situation, you've got to stick with your big guns. Carter always has the potential to find the end zone. Booker faces a pathetic Detroit secondary, and Horn has a great matchup vs. Carolina's league-worst defense. Despite the fact that Conway has a great matchup against Seattle CB Willie Williams, you've got to go with Carter, Booker and Horn. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Benjamin Collins, Brooklyn, N.Y.: Tiki Barber may have started the season slowly, but he's been one of the most reliable running backs in the league over the last three weeks. It seems Jim Fassel is losing more and more faith in Ron Dayne, which means more carries and consistent Fantasy production for Barber.

1782,"Paulette,

It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT 60 payment. Enron
would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the
winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and
eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look
at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment
once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire
transfers.

Thanks again for your patience.

Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have
January and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

Roman and Paulette,

Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday

bill, he can pay this one too.

Thank you for your patience during this transition.

1783,"I extended deal 559947 (Pool sale) thru the 31st, a volume of 27935 per day.

I changed storage deal 456379 from 196985 to 46985 on the 31st ONLY!!

Joann,  for Jan, we are selling New Power 31,679 out of the pool and 25893 
from other sources (AO6, Broad Run, Delmont, and Monclova - this includes the 
AO6 they are buying from us).  Which means we should only have 3844 out of 
the pool.


Actually the citygate and storage should be as follows

Vol Comment
3844 Out of the pool
25893 Other receipt supply
xxxx Storage - and this should match whats on the storage ticket.

Dear Producers and Shippers,

 In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant 
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many 
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz 
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.  
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen 
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, 
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:

 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 

 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
         processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. 

 We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian 
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.  
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson 
at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.


        Sincerely,


        H. Dale Rexrode
        Director, Producer Services
        and Business Development

1796,"As evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter, 
Enron,s wholesale energy businesses in North America and Europe continue to 
experience tremendous growth.  The opportunities to continue to grow our 
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to 
Enron,s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses 
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.

It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of 
gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnings 
growth.  We have made significant progress in developing these businesses in 
North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net Works business unit.  
Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products, 
coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest rates, credit 
trading, paper and pulp, and metals.

While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to 
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to 
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North America 
and Europe.  In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on 
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today 
announcing the formation of a new business unit ) Enron Global Markets.  This 
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in 
scope, but outside our traditional gas and power markets.  This new core 
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with 
the North American and European businesses.

Enron Global Markets will be headed by Mike McConnell, President and Chief 
Executive Officer, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer.  They will 
report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Enron Global Markets.  Mark, 
Mike and Jeff will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Global 
Markets.

Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the 
Chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders:
- Global Crude and Products:     John Nowlan
- Coal:         George McClellan
- Currency, equities, interest rate and agricultural trading:  Gary Hickerson
- Insurance and weather:      Jere Overdyke

Enron,s metals business and Enron Credit.com will remain the responsibility 
of Enron Europe. The Paper and Pulp business will continue to reside in North 
America. 

With the departure of Mike McConnell from Enron Net Works, we are pleased to 
announce the following appointments in that business unit:
- Jeff McMahon: President and Chief Operating Officer
- Louise Kitchen: Chief Commercial Officer
- Philippe Bibi:  Chief Technology Officer

Jeff, Louise and Philippe, along with Greg Whalley,  will comprise the Office 
of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.

With Jeff Shankman,s departure from Enron North America,s natural gas 
operation, all of Jeff,s direct reports will report to John Lavorato.

We are also pleased to announce the following changes to the Enron North 
America Office of the Chairman.  John Lavorato will join the ENA Office of 
the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Dave Delainey will assume the role 
of President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mark Frevert will retain his role 
as Chairman of Enron North America in addition to his role as Chairman of 
both Enron Global Markets and Enron Europe.

Please join us in congratulating everyone in their new assignments and in 
supporting the new Enron Global Markets organisation.
"
1797,"I've clarified the language in 2(a).

Paul / Dan:

A summary of the alternatives related to the LNG winter cargo follows:

	1. If we don't do anything and Cabot does not deliver: 
		a. We may save $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges, but will have exposure to spot fuel prices at a time when prices are expected to rise.

	2. Write a letter to Cabot notifying them that we have an opportunity to secure a winter cargo now and have them confirm their commitment to a winter cargo delivery. 

		a. Should Cabot commit to a winter cargo we would be in the same position we are today with the exception that they no longer have the ability to cancel the winter cargo on short notice. If we later decline to receive the winter cargo we still pay the $4.7 million in demand charge and surcharge. We would decline to nominate a winter cargo from Cabot only if spot fuel prices are lower than the commodity charge and surcharge.	
					
		b. Should Cabot not commit to a delivery we are relieved of the obligation to pay the $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges and can buy a spot cargo at an additional savings. The total potential benefit to EcoElectrica of the transaction can be close to $5 million at the current LNG prices (this scenario will be better if prices go down)..

Given where the LNG market is today we should proceed to send the letter to Cabot.

Jaime, Oscar:

Have reviewed the possibility of purchasing a non-Cabot Winter Cargo.  Please review and comment.  The analysis should be looked at in conjunction with the narrative written by Paul included in the attached email.  For detail of analysis, refer to the following Excel icon. 

 


	Items for Consideration and/or Assumptions 	

Cabot's willingness to release the right  not deliver the Winter Cargo (time is of essence in getting Cabot to make this decision in Eco's favor)
Purchase of non-Cabot cargo at 10 cents lower than our 2002 Estimated Commodity Charge and Surcharge Rate. Should consider other scenarios. 	
PRCPI growth of 5.5%, could be updated given the availability of 4-month actual data. 
NYMEX to be continued updating - actual and future. 
Have not considered other incidental expenses related to the transaction.

Ernesto,

Below is a discussion of some of the key contractual issues surrounding the 2002 Winter Cargo. You may also want to review the contract to gain an understanding of how the delivery dates are set for the Last Cargo of 2001, the 2002 Winter Cargo, and the 2002 Early Spring Cargo.

We can discuss this opportunity for Eco in a few days after you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the issues.

Regards,

Paul

Subject:	Eco Winter Cargo

Below are the key points of a conference call held on Friday, May 11, 2001. Attending were Gene Massey of Arent Fox and Coralina Rivera, Dan Masters, and Paul Y'Barbo of Enron. The call was in reference to the LNG supply contract between EcoElectrica and Cabot LNG. Enron LNG got the answers it hoped to get and more.

1. Article 12.3 gives Cabot the right to not deliver a Winter Cargo to Eco if Cabot is unable to complete an Algerian Loading within a window specified in the contract. Cabot could give notice to Eco as late as 3 days prior to the scheduled loading of the Winter Cargo that Cabot will be unable to deliver the cargo. The failure to complete the Algerian Loading must not be the result of a default by Cabot or Distrigas. The failure to achieve an Algerian Loading may not necessarily be the result of an Algerian Force Majeure situation. 

2. Article 12.3 (b) (iv) gives Eco the right to secure replacement fuel for the Winter Cargo. If Eco notices Cabot that Eco has the opportunity to secure replacement fuel, then Cabot has 10 days to notify Eco whether or not they are willing to release the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Eco may buy replacement fuel regardless of whether or not Cabot releases the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. In other words, even if Cabot commits to delivery of a Winter Cargo, Eco is under no obligation to purchase a Winter Cargo from Cabot. 

If Cabot is unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo, then Eco will buy the replacement fuel and will not have to pay the Demand Charge or Demand Surcharge on the Winter Cargo, a quantity equal to 119,000 cubic meters (~$4.7 MM).

If Cabot releases its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo and Eco still buys the replacement fuel, then Eco will receive no reduction in the annual Demand Charges and Demand Surcharge.

Eco has until December 1st to give notice that it has the opportunity to buy replacement fuel. It was Gene's opinion that the sooner Eco gives notice (today would be good), the less likely Cabot would be willing to give up its right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Thus, the more likely Eco would be able to get a reduction in Demand Charges and elimination of the Demand Surcharge.

Important Note: The economics of the deal work such that the largest monetary benefit of buying replacement fuel exists when December/January/February U.S. natural gas prices are at their lowest point of the year.

If U.S. natural gas prices were to go down a little further, Eco would want to buy more non-Cabot LNG than just the Winter Cargo replacement.

3. Per Article 7.5, Eco's annual purchase commitment is 66% of the LNG consumed at the Power Facility up to a maximum of 19.46 TBtu (~7 Standard Cargoes). In a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco would need to ""purchase"" 6 Standard Cargoes from Cabot. Failure to do so would result in payment of liquidated damages of approximately $0.36/MMBtu.

Important Note: Per Article 7.5, if replacement fuel is purchased rather than buying a Winter Cargo from Cabot, that quantity counts as though it were purchased from Cabot for the purpose of assessing whether or not Eco met its annual purchase commitment. Thus, in a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco could buy replacement fuel instead of a Cabot Winter Cargo plus 5 Standard Cargoes from Cabot and still meet its annual commitment.

There are benefits to Eco for buying replacement fuel - certainty of supply and a lower price. Enron LNG should continue to pursue a deal with Eco. I plan to schedule a meeting with Mariella Mahan as soon as she is available.

I will provide an update of the economics of this trade in my next e-mail.

1804,"1. I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today.  I think that 
the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for 
transmission pricing and energy markets.

2. To make more clear about the Regional Plans, I think that we need to 
consider the following.

A. BACKGROUND

Timelines of Current Process
Current Players & Current Positions
Allies 
Key Issues now facing the process

B. MOVING FORWARD

Top Issues upcoming
External Factors (e.g., will Entergy join SPP)
Resource Needs
Relationship to Commercial Objectives / Business Plans

C. OTHER ISSUES / CONCLUSION

I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans.  The key idea is 
that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and 
what issues need to be addressed.  Don't be shy about adding other topics and 
issues.  We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the 
commercial people.  I don't expect this to be easy, but I think that it will 
be helpful.

3. I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure.  This 
would entail developing four things (1) a tariff, (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures, (3) Day Ahead PX Energy Market, (4) Transmission Flowgate PX 
Market.  These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace.

My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using 
""off the shelf"" material.  I know that Tom Delaney has already started 
working on a tariff.  I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point 3.  
We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point 4.  On the ISO, maybe 
we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope / Work Plan and fees on setting 
up an ISO (including costs of operation over time).  It would make sense to 
me to do this very formally (including setting energy market zones and 
defining the commercially significant Flowgates).  I would use the MISO as 
the market to focus on, but am willing to listen to other thoughts.

Please let me know what everyone thinks.

Jim

Looks fine to me but Kristina Mordaunt or one of her staff need to be my final eyes and ears.  One note - the non-solicit covers people that we come in contact with through the process - I suggest we make a quick check that we are currently not in discussions with anyone at the company already.

Gentlemen - 

We are working on a non-disclosure agreement with eonxchange, Inc., a software company involved in the building, licensing and operating of ""smart electronic exchanges"" through the use of ""thought-ware.""  The basis for the NDA is the disclosure between the companies of software products and ideas (associated with the EOL software) and discussions concerning a possible transaction involving either the purchase or long term license of some aspects of the products eonxchange owns.  This possible transaction is in association with an ongoing project by ENW involving the EOL software.

The original NDA provided was provided to ENW through a financial advisor to eonxchange (Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin Capital) and contained a unilateral non-solicitation provision in favor of eonxchange.  We have responded a bilateral provision consistent with our standard non-solicitation provision.  I have attempted to further limit this language so that it would only be applicable between eonxchange and ENW (and not affiliates/subsidiary and parent companies).  This was, however, rejected by eonxchange.

I have attached the most current provision below for your review, comment and/or approval.  At your convenience, please let me know if the attached is acceptable for the eonxchange non-disclosure agreement.

If any of you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

1806,"I'll be in the office very shortly.  My converstation with Fielder (SCE SVP I've been talking to about the PX credit) yesterday afternoon regarding the settlement was not very fulfilling:
 

he said there's still disagreement about what they owe us for the PX credit
he made a point to include in our conversation the provision in the settlement that requires Edison to ""cooperate"" with the AG and the PUC in litigation against generators/marketers

I told him that we needed to get the payment issue resolved very quickly.  He said that they needed a day or two to regroup and that they intended to call each and every creditor to discuss next steps.

Michael:  I call you soon as I get in--next 15-30 minutes.

Enron's Net Soars, Despite Telecom Loss, Gaining 40% Amid Strong Energy Units
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. posted a 40% increase in second-quarter net income, reflecting 
the enormous profitability of its energy marketing and trading enterprise, 
which was sufficient to offset wider-than-expected losses at its 
telecommunications unit. 
The Houston company had net income of $404 million, compared with $289 
million a year earlier, on revenue that nearly tripled to $50 billion. 
Earnings per share rose 32% to 45 cents from 34 cents.
Enron was lifted by exceptionally strong electricity- and gas-trading 
volumes. In North America, natural-gas volumes jumped 9% and 
electricity-trading volumes jumped 71%. In Europe, where Enron is pushing 
aggressively into newly deregulated markets, trading volumes for gas more 
than doubled and for electricity leapt to almost five times those of before. 
>From practically nothing just two years ago, Europe generates one-quarter of 
Enron's energy-trading volumes. 
Profits from trading more than compensated for a $101 million loss posted for 
the company's telecommunications business that analysts had, until recently, 
proclaimed would soon generate more income than Enron's energy business. For 
the quarter, bandwidth-service revenue was $16 million. The unit posted a 
loss of $8 million for the year-earlier quarter. 
Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, said prices for capacity on 
fiber-optic networks, such as the one Enron has built, have been ""dropping 
like a rock. . . . We've been shocked at the extent."" 
Mr. Skilling said the company is trying to boost revenue by focusing on 
fiber-optic delivery of data and entertainment -- ""a narrow piece of the 
business but about all that's left"" -- and is hoping the glut in capacity 
will evaporate as competitors go broke. He said companies that continue to 
invest, despite the ""market meltdown,"" and keep their networks state of the 
art will be rewarded eventually. 
Enron's results beat analysts' expectations, but several said they fear 
softening electricity prices throughout the nation, and particularly in the 
West, could crimp third-quarter results. ""Enron benefited from unusual price 
volatility,"" during the quarter, said Raymond Niles, an energy analyst for 
Salomon Smith Barney. But it is uncertain whether that will continue with a 
general softening of natural-gas and electricity prices across the country, 
most notably in the West. 
Mr. Skilling said he thinks California may have seen the worst of its energy 
crisis. He consistently has said he doesn't think Enron's earnings will be 
significantly affected by possible refund orders from federal energy 
regulators or other regulatory intervention. 
He added that Enron was pleased with steps the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission took this week to encourage the formation of four big 
electric-transmission grid operators in the West, the Northeast, the 
Southeast and the Midwest.

Enron Net Rose 40% in Quarter
Bloomberg News

The New York Times
Page 12, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, July 12 -- The Enron Corporation, an energy trader, said today that 
its second-quarter profit rose 40 percent as its sales of natural gas and 
electricity surged in the United States and Europe. 
Net income rose to $404 million, or 45 cents a share, from $289 million, or 
34 cents, in the period a year ago, Enron said. Results beat analysts' 
estimates by 3 cents a share.
Revenue almost tripled to $50.1 billion. Enron, which is based in Houston, 
sold almost twice as much power in North America and five times as much in 
Europe than in the quarter a year ago. 
Although electricity and natural gas prices surged in California, Jeffrey K. 
Skilling, the chief executive of Enron, said the state ''is just not a big 
factor'' in Enron's increasing profits. The company bolsters earnings by 
increasing sales of energy and other commodities like lumber and steel rather 
than by raising prices, analysts said. 
''That's the nature of the commodities business,'' said Zach Wagner, an 
analyst with Edward Jones & Company. ''As markets open up, their volumes will 
grow. Their margins are basically flat.'' 
Enron's profit margin was less than 1 percent last year and has averaged 2.1 
percent the last five years, based on Bloomberg data. That compares with a 
profit margin of 6.5 percent for Exxon Mobil, the largest publicly traded 
energy company. 
Shares of Enron have dropped 31 percent the last year, despite steadily 
increasing earnings, and sales that now rival those of Exxon Mobil. Shares of 
Enron rose 45 cents today, to $49.55. 
Enron was expected to make 42 cents a share in the quarter, the average 
estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.

Treasury Prices Climb as More Money Is Shifted To U.S. Bonds on Weakness of 
Emerging Markets
By Michael Mackenzie and Andrew Gelfand
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C12

NEW YORK -- Treasury prices closed higher as renewed weakness in emerging 
markets prompted investors to shift more money into the U.S. bond market. 
It is common for Wall Street traders to bid Treasurys higher when weakness in 
other markets seems likely to spur flows into Treasurys, which are viewed as 
a haven.
But yesterday's action involved more than just Wall Street firms and provided 
substantial support, mostly offsetting the bearish influence of a stock 
rally. ""Argentina is keeping a good bid in the [Treasury] market,"" said Peter 
Cordrey, managing director at Prudential Investment Management in New Jersey. 
Much of the focus again was Argentina, whose long-term sovereign credit 
rating yesterday was cut by Standard & Poor's to single-B-minus from 
single-B. 
S&P said the ratings outlook for Argentina remained negative and cited 
""growing strain on the cohesion of the governing coalition and the risk that 
it may impede efforts by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo to implement 
draconian measures to balance the federal budget."" 
That country is ""just looking worse and worse every time you turn around,"" 
said Drew Matus, market economist with Lehman Brothers in New York. 
Despite indications that Argentine officials are trying to win agreement on 
spending cuts, investors remained nervous about the nation's ability to 
service its large external debt burden. Prices of Argentine floating-rate 
bonds fell about 103/8 points to 623/8. 
In U.S. Treasury trading, meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year note at 4 p.m. EDT 
was up 8/32 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face value, at 98 6/32. Its yield fell 
to 5.242% from 5.276% late Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. 
The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 14/32 at 96 1/32 to yield 5.652%, 
down from 5.684% Wednesday. 
Shorter Treasury maturities preformed less strongly than longer ones, and 
analysts cited gains in stocks as a reason. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 237.97 points to 10478.99, and the 
Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 103.70 points to 2,075.74. Treasurys are being 
""pulled in two directions, and the stock market is winning in the [short] 
end,"" said Richard Gilhooly, senior bond strategist at Paribas Capital 
Markets in New York. 
Another factor bolstering Treasurys was economic news. In two early releases, 
the Labor Department reported both a huge rise in claims for state 
unemployment benefits and slightly lower prices for imported goods. 
The number of workers filing first-time applications for jobless benefits 
jumped by 42,000 to 445,000 in the week ended July 7, the highest level since 
about mid-1992. That raised the four-week moving average to 410,750 claims. 
Today, two other economic reports may dominate the attention of bond 
investors: the producer price index and retail sales, both for June. 
A Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey found that economists believe the PPI was 
unchanged in June and will show a slight 0.1% increase in the month excluding 
food and energy. ""The friendly inflation news should help to keep a bid in 
long [dated] Treasurys,"" said Gemma Wright, a bond-market strategist at 
Barclays Capital in New York. 
A separate Dow Jones Newswires poll found that economists expect to see a 
0.3% rise in overall retail sales in June, or a 0.2% sales gain excluding 
automobiles. 
Corporate Bonds 
Marlin Water Trust II sold $475 million and 515 million euros ($439 million) 
of securities via Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. 
In 1998, Enron Corp. created a special-purpose entity, to finance the 
purchase of water utility Wessex Water PLC of the United Kingdom. Yesterday's 
issue was a refinancing of that debt, but was done in a way that keeps the 
debt off Enron's balance sheet, underwriting officials said. 
The U.S. portion of the deal was priced to yield 6.31%, or 2.25 percentage 
points over Treasurys. In early trading, it was quoted at 2.25 percentage 
points over Treasurys, which was ""reasonably positive on a day when the 
corporate market was so jittery,"" said Stephen Kane, portfolio manager at 
Metropolitan West Asset Management. 
Generally, investment-grade corporate bonds weakened on concerns about 
emerging markets. Yield margins to Treasurys, an important performance gauge, 
widened by 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point. 
Separately, Citigroup Inc. tapped the market with $2 billion of two-year 
global floating-rate notes priced to yield 0.09 percentage point over 
three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor. 
Agency Securities 
Fannie Mae sold $2.5 billion of callable benchmark securities, which traded 
strongly afterward. 
Its $1.5 billion of 5.5%, five-year notes yielded 5.5657%, or 0.05 percentage 
point over the Fannie Mae benchmark level on an option-adjusted spread basis. 
An additional $1 billion of 6.25%, 10-year notes yielded 6.408%, or 0.03 
percentage point over the Fannie Mae benchmark level on an option-adjusted 
basis. 
Scott Graham, head of agency trading at Greenwich Capital Markets, said his 
company saw ""a number of customers"" who don't typically consider callable 
issues, but were nonetheless looking to buy some of the new securities.

THE ENERGY CRISIS Some State Energy Consultants Own Generators' Stock Ethics: 
They negotiate deals and buy electricity from power firms. GOP officials 
claim credit for forcing the disclosure of potential conflict.
ERIC BAILEY
TIMES STAFF WRITER

07/13/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition

SACRAMENTO -- More than half a dozen consultants hired by the state to 
purchase electricity and to negotiate long-term power deals own stock in 
generating companies such as Calpine and Enron that have profited handsomely 
during California's energy crisis. 
The potential conflict of interest emerged Thursday with the release of 
financial disclosure statements by consultants who have been hired by the 
state since the start of the power crunch.
Among those disclosing stock ownership were two key negotiators of long-term 
energy contracts and two workers hired to purchase electricity from 
generators, including some of the firms in which they hold an interest. 
Several other consultants who played key roles in the state's energy efforts 
decided not to file financial disclosure statements, citing legal exemptions 
under state law. 
Among those who did not file the financial disclosure statements were a pair 
of executives at two Wall Street firms that stand to make $14 million if the 
state buys California's power grid. Of about 50 consultants hired by the 
state in the past six months, 27 filed the disclosures. 
The disclosures follow a firestorm in Sacramento last month over the hiring 
by Gov. Gray Davis of two media consultants also employed by Southern 
California Edison, the troubled utility that is negotiating with the state 
over a bailout package. 
Steve Maviglio, a Davis spokesman, said the governor's legal staff was 
reviewing the financial disclosure forms for any potential conflicts of 
interest. 
""If there's anything inappropriate,"" Maviglio said, ""then we'll deal with 
it."" 
Republicans, however, said the hired workers had revealed overt conflicts 
that clearly violated state law. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican running for governor against 
Davis next year, said the revelations call into question the work performed 
by the consultants on high-priced energy contracts that are ""going to 
mortgage our children's future for decades to come."" 
""If you show a conflict, the potential is there for collusion,"" Jones said. 
""I'm not accusing anyone, but that's why you have disclosure."" 
Rob Stutzman, a state GOP spokesman, said he was particularly troubled 
because the consultants had delayed filing the disclosure forms for months. 
Under state law, the forms are supposed to be submitted within 30 days after 
the consultants go to work for the state. 
Most of the energy consultants, who could not be reached for comment, 
reported owning relatively small amounts of stock in energy firms, generally 
less than $10,000. 
But one of the new workers, William Mead, disclosed that he owned between 
$100,000 and$1 million in Calpine, a San Jose-based energy firm. Mead did not 
report when the stock had been purchased. 
Only one of the contractors reported selling off stock after coming to work 
for the state. 
Vikram Budhraja, president of Pasadena-based Electric Power Group LLC, on 
Jan. 11 purchased between $10,000 and $100,000 in stock of Dynegy, a 
electricity and natural gas producer. He sold it off on Jan. 29, 10 days 
after he came to work for the state. Budhraja has been a top negotiator of 
the state's long-term energy contracts, which have included a deal concluded 
March 2 with Dynegy. 
Richard Ferreira, a retired Sacramento Utility District executive hired by 
the state to negotiate long-term power contracts, reported the purchase of 
between $2,000 and $10,000 of stock in Calpine, a San Jose-based energy firm, 
in August 2000. He also purchased a similar amount of stock in General 
Electric Co., which produces power plant equipment, in April 2000. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, reported that he owned an undisclosed 
amount of stock in Enron Corp., a big Texas-based energy firm. Elaine Griffin 
purchased between $10,000 and $100,000 in Calpine stock on Feb. 1, less than 
three weeks before she came to work for the state as an energy trader. 
Constantine Louie, an energy scheduler, reported owning between $10,000 and 
$100,000 in Calpine stock. 
Republicans took credit for forcing the Davis administration to file the 
reports, a charge the governor's office brushed aside. 
Jones, the secretary of state, held a news conference Tuesday to complain 
about the failure of nearly all the state's energy consultants to file any 
sort of financial disclosure forms. The statements were only made available 
late in the afternoon Thursday, months after many consultants went to work 
for the state. 
Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said the delays were explained in part by 
negotiations that began in March with the Fair Political Practices 
Commission, the state's ethics watchdog, to determine if the consultants were 
required to file the forms. 
He also suggested that Jones' accusations were fueled more by campaign 
politics than any devotion to constitutional duty. 
""One needs to question why the secretary of state is using taxpayer money to 
investigate something beyond his jurisdiction,"" Maviglio said. ""That's why we 
have an FPPC, to look at these kinds of things.""

THE ENERGY CRISIS Plan Uses Public in Refund Demand Legislature: Democrats' 
proposal to pressure 'greedy' firms is attacked by GOP as political ploy.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

07/13/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

SACRAMENTO -- The Democratic-led state Senate intends to fill constituent 
mailboxes with a taxpayer-financed appeal urging Californians to demand 
nearly $9 billion in energy price refunds from ""greedy out-of-state power 
generators."" 
Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) said the mailers will ask 
Californians to join the Senate and Gov. Gray Davis in insisting that the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order the refunds of alleged overcharges.
Senate Democrats set the high target despite a federal mediator's ruling 
against Davis earlier this week. The mediator said California would be 
entitled to only about $1 billion in generator overcharges, not the $8.9 
billion that Davis has fought for. 
Senate officers said the cost of the mail campaign will be paid from the 
budgets of senators, at taxpayer expense, as part of the Legislature's 
constituent service mail program. 
But Republicans attacked the mailer as political propaganda that may violate 
state law and Senate policy barring issuance of ""partisan"" documents at 
public expense. 
Sketchy details of the quietly developed project surfaced on the Senate floor 
Thursday. Staffers who worked on it said it was virtually impossible to 
calculate the program's cost. 
But they indicated that if all 26 Democrats agreed to send up to 30,000 
mailers each to constituents, the postage alone would cost $140,400. 
If each mass mailing exceeded 30,000 pieces, a higher postage rate would 
apply, raising the cost, officials said. 
In the mailer, constituents are asked to return an attached card to their 
state senator, urging ""full refunds of the outrageous prices charged by the 
greedy out-of-state power generators."" 
Cynthia Lavagetto, manager of the Senate mail program, said each member will 
decide what do do with the returned cards, including simply filing them or 
sending them on to FERC. 
Lavagetto said a prototype mailer was prepared with the help of the Select 
Committee on Citizen Participation, a panel that has no chairman or members, 
since it has not been activated this year. But it does maintain an office and 
has three staffers on the Senate payroll. 
Burton dismissed the Republican charges of partisanship as baseless. ""We do 
this all the time on a variety of issues,"" he said. ""We're saying, 'Stop 
stealing California's money.' "" 
But Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, the Senate's senior Republican, denounced 
the mailing as clearly partisan. He said it appeared to reflect a developing 
2002 election strategy of Davis and Democrats to blame the FERC and 
out-of-state generators for California's energy mess. 
""I seriously question the appropriateness of using taxpayer money to get 
people to lobby [for the refunds],"" Johnson said. 
Johnson and Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) suggested that Democrats turn their 
criticism to municipal utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power. Some utilities charged the state even higher prices last 
winter than did private generators. 
""Why are they not attacking the DWP?"" Johnson asked. 
He noted that S. David Freeman was running the DWP at the time some of its 
highest prices were charged to the state, which is buying power for 
California's financially crippled utilities. Later, Davis hired Freeman as 
his top energy price negotiator. 
""Doesn't David Freeman more properly belong in that same jail cell as the guy 
called Spike than he does in the governor's office?"" Johnson asked. 
""Spike"" has become a character in the California energy debate, thanks to 
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who is investigating whether power sellers engaged 
in price-gouging and antitrust behavior. 
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in May, Lockyer said he would 
""love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 
cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi. My name is 
Spike, honey.' ""

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Surging energy sales behind Enron advance.

Enron, the US energy trader, yesterday posted a 40 per cent rise in 
second-quarter profits to $404m, due to surging gas and electricity sales in 
North America and Europe. 
The Houston-based company also said it would continue to grow aggressively in 
Europe and seize any opportunities to expand in the US, after regulators on 
Wednesday ordered the formation of an organisation to open the North American 
electricity market.
Jeff Skilling, Enron chief executive, said the company had its sights set on 
Europe for strong earnings growth, which it hopes will eventually match North 
America. 
The company's wholesale business unit, the group's main profit driver, 
derives 70 per cent of its business from North America. 
""We see more growth opportunity in Europe than in North America. Gas volumes 
are up more than 100 per cent (in the quarter),"" Mr Skilling said. ""The gas 
and electric market in Europe is almost as big as North America and we got an 
early start."" 
Mr Skilling said a decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
order the formation of four grid organisations to optimise the transmission 
of electricity in parts of the US was hugely important. 
He estimated only 20 per cent of the wholesale market for electricity could 
be accessed and the decision would take this to 90-95 per cent. 
Mr Skilling said Enron, which has transformed itself from a pipeline company 
into a large energy trader, was focused on its volumes, not revenues, which 
jumped to $50.1bn in the quarter, from $16.9bn a year ago. 
The only poor performer was the broadband division, which trades space on 
fibre-optic networks. The unit posted a loss of $102m in the quarter, against 
an $8m loss a year ago, and the company said it would cut costs there. 
Enron's result of $404m, or 45 cents a share, compared with $289m, or 34 
cents, in the same quarter a year ago. 
Analysts had been expecting 42 cents a share. 
By the close in New York, the company's shares were trading 45 cents higher 
to $49.55. See Lex.

Lex - Enron.

07/13/2001
Financial Times - FT.com

Be careful of the company you keep. Having enjoyed its status as a 
telecommunications play last year, Enron is now suffering with its new 
friends. The US energy trader has dropped by 40 per cent since the start of 
the year - underperforming the market by a third - despite the earnings 
momentum in its core energy trading business. 
A 40 per cent increase in net income in the second quarter, even allowing for 
inevitable questions over earnings quality, is impressive. The strength of 
the energy trading business, with volumes up by almost 60 per cent, is more 
than enough to offset the misery in the broadband trading business.
However, the broadband division's $102m losses are shocking, even in these 
difficult times. The market has collapsed, partly owing to credit problems in 
the telecoms sector. Enron's cost base is completely out of kilter with the 
opportunity. At least it should not be too hard to put that right. Actual 
investment in assets is limited; and by reallocating staff to the 
fast-growing energy trading divisions, restructuring costs can be kept to a 
minimum. 
Broadband is not the only worry. California's troubles have not affected 
trading volumes, but regulatory risk remains, while promises on asset sales 
have not been met. Trading on 23 times 2002 forecast earnings, the valuation 
looks fair for a fast-growing trading company. The upside lies in convincing 
investors to give the company more credit for its value-added risk management 
services. The long-term potential of broadband trading, meanwhile, is thrown 
in for free.

White House adviser targeted for dealings with Salvation Army
By RON FOURNIER
AP White House Correspondent

07/13/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Senior White House adviser Karl Rove, increasingly a target 
of criticism from Democrats and Republicans, wound up at the center of a new 
storm over his dealings with the Salvation Army. 
White House aides rallied to his side, and Rove was unapologetic. But 
Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe called for 
congressional hearings.
""I think the truth needs to come out,"" McAuliffe said Thursday. ""Let's have 
hearings and get to the bottom of this."" 
At issue was the Salvation Army's push for a regulation allowing religious 
charities to practice workplace discrimination against gays, and Rove's 
actions on behalf of the group. Rove said he was simply doing his job. 
While McAuliffe called for hearings, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, 
D-S.D., seemed less riled. ""Karl Rove is a very respected individual and I 
wouldn't have any comment to make,"" Daschle said. 
Thursday's flap was not the first for Rove, who oversees politics, strategy 
and public liaison at the White House. 
When Sen. James Jeffords bolted the GOP and turned the Senate over to 
Democrats last month, Republicans accused Rove of alienating the Vermont 
lawmaker during the tax-cut debate. He was fingered, too, for not warning 
Bush earlier that Jeffords might jump ship. 
When Rove sat in White House meetings on policy that could impact his stock 
portfolio, Democrats demanded to know whether his holdings with Houston-based 
Enron Corp. and Intel Corp. created a conflict of interest. 
When Bush crossed some military advisers and suspended Navy bombing on the 
Puerto Rican island of Vieques, Rove's involvement in the case was held up as 
proof by critics that the decision was politically-motivated. 
Rove's involvement in the Salvation Army case has stirred debate in 
Republican and Democratic circles about whether he wields too much power and 
is too political for the White House. 
The White House rejected the Salvation Army's request Wednesday, but only 
after the revelation of an embarrassing Salvation Army memo. The memo said 
the administration had promised to issue a regulation protecting it and other 
religious charities from efforts to prevent such discrimination in exchange 
for the Salvation Army's support of Bush's plan to open government programs 
to religious groups. 
White House officials left the impression that no senior officials were 
involved in the discussions, failing to point out Rove's activity until 
Thursday. 
In a telephone interview, Rove said he recalled having just three or four 
brief discussions on the topic. He received a request from a Salvation Army 
ally to looked into the rule, sent the ally to the White House faith-based 
office, forwarded the written request to a government lawyer and was told 
later by the lawyer, ""We're not certain there's anything we can do."" 
The lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, told reporters the request lay dormant after his 
discussion with Rove. 
Rove rejected the criticism. ""My job is not to say, `Don't send me something 
or call me.' My job is to keep my eyes and ears open and send things to the 
appropriate departments,"" he said. 
Some top Republicans outside the White House said Rove has become a 
lightening rod. 
""Part of his role is to be a deflection shield for the president,"" said GOP 
consultant Rich Bond. ""Everytime Karl takes a hit, it's one less hit the 
president has to take. Karl knows that and he is a big boy."" 
Aides say the president is not troubled by Rove's actions, even joking about 
the controversies. 
White House chief of staff Andrew Card also defended Rove. 
""I may be naive, but we have no problem of division on the senior level,"" 
said Card. ""I was in the Reagan White House when we had three clear camps ... 
We don't have that here."" 
Aides do acknowledge, however, that there is some resentment of Rove in the 
lower ranks of the White House. Some grumbled that Rove did not let White 
House press secretary Ari Fleischer know Wednesday about his involvement in 
the Salvation Army case. Others, still tired from a tough campaign and 
frustrated by their new jobs, said they resent Rove's wide reach.

UK: Bidder list for Southern Water grows-report.

07/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - More potential bidders have emerged that may 
challenge Italian utility ENEL for Southern Water, the British regional 
utility put up for sale by its parent Scottish Power Plc earlier this year, a 
trade magazine reported on Friday. 
Utility Week said British gas and homes services retailer Centrica had teamed 
up with French utility Vivendi Environnement , which already owns UK water 
assets, ""to consider a bid"".
But it cited unnamed sources saying the German-owned investment bank WestLB 
Panmure, which was behind a management buyout of Southern Water's neighbour 
Mid Kent Water earlier this year, had ""emerged as front-runner in the past 
week"". 
ENEL has said it is interested, and according to Reuters' industry sources 
Scottish Power's floor price is 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) excluding 
any attached debt. 
Scottish Power said in March the business was for sale. 
It needs the cash to help fund its own plans for expansion in the United 
States, where industry sources say it has held talks on buying Portland 
General, a power utility owned by Enron Corp , which neighbours the UK 
group's own PacifiCorp arm.

DPC not to re-start work on Phase II work

Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) today said that Enron Corp chairman 
Kenneth Lay during his meetings with the Centre and the Maharashtra 
government had not agreed to any proposal to complete the construction of 
phase-II of the power project. 
""Dabhol Power Company believes that a decision to recommence construction 
cannot be made unless various issues relating to the project are completely 
resolved,"" DPC said in a statement.
It said that any discussion that Lay had on recommending construction of 
phase-II was in the context of the current uncertainties surrounding the 
project. 
DPC said that contractors working on the project resorted to termination due 
to non-payment of their dues as lenders had stopped disbursing funds. 
""This decision was taken as a result of continuing defaults by MSEB 
(Maharashtra State Electricity Board), including MSEB's repudiation of the 
PPA, their failure to pay outstanding invoices and their stated unwillingness 
to accept phase-II power, as well as failure of the government guarantors to 
honour their payment guarantees,"" said the statement. 
It added that the situation had not changed.

California Power Bills Exceed Refunds, Judge Says (Update4)
2001-07-12 21:40 (New York)

California Power Bills Exceed Refunds, Judge Says (Update4)

     (Adds legislator comment in sixth paragraph, details from
judge in 11th paragraph, negotiator comment in 12th paragraph.)

     Washington, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- California's debts to
power sellers for electricity purchases exceed any refund the
state can claim for alleged overcharging, a judge overseeing
settlement talks said in a report to federal regulators.
     California and its utilities may be owed more than $1 billion
on claims generators overcharged them, Administrative Law Judge
Curtis Wagner wrote in a report to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. California alleges power sellers like Duke Energy
Corp., Enron Corp. illegally inflated prices by $8.9 billion.
     ``While there are vast sums due for overcharges, there are
even larger amounts owed to energy sellers'' by California and its
utilities, Wagner wrote. He said the state is owed ``hundreds of
millions of dollars, probably more than a billion dollars.''
     The decision strengthens the generators' claim that the
state's request for billions isn't supported by the facts. Energy
companies have offered a total of $716 million in refunds to the
state, Wagner said.
     FERC-ordered negotiations between the state and the energy
sellers broke down without an agreement this week. FERC will
decide on the size of refunds within 60 days. California Governor
Gray Davis has said the state will sue if it does not receive the
refunds it demanded.
     ``I find it unlikely that someone will not be unhappy enough
to go to court,'' said State Senator Debra Bowen, a Democrat from
Los Angeles. ``There's too much money at stake.''

                         Wagner's Report

     FERC will use Wagner's report to calculate the size of any
refunds. California could receive refunds in the form of credit
against power-buying debts. In his report, Wagner didn't say how
much the state and its utilities owe to power companies.
     ``Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is
due the seller? The chief judge thinks not,'' wrote Wagner, who is
FERC's chief administrative law judge.
     Wagner provided suggestions to the FERC commissioners on how
to set any refunds. He urged that they calculate potential
overcharges beginning October 2000. California had urged the
settlement be figured from May 2000.
     Davis criticized that decision, calling it ``a $3 billion
free gouge for the generators'' in a statement released by his
office.
     The judge said California had rejected a settlement offer he
made during the talks. He did not say what that settlement offer
was. He said California would not budge from its initial demand.
He also said California did not provide him some of the background
information he requested until this week.
     ``If we had more time we might have been able to respond more
quickly, but we did the best we could,'' said Michael Kahn,
chairman of the Independent System Operator, the state's electric
grid manager. He led the state delegation.

                    Heart of Dispute

     At the heart of the dispute are federal regulations that
require power sellers to charge only those rates deemed by federal
regulators to be ``just and reasonable.'' FERC had price caps in
place when some of the disputed power purchases were made.
     Energy companies claim that rising natural-gas prices and a
lack of adequate supply pushed prices up. The state accuses the
companies reaping unreasonable profits.
     Davis has made attacks on power generators a staple of his
response to the energy crisis, and has accused them of gouging the
state in dozens of speeches since January. He said that if the
state isn't paid $8.9 billion, it would sue for up to $20 billion.
     Energy executives accuse Davis and California political
leaders of attempting to scapegoat the energy companies for a
failed deregulation plan that led to soaring wholesale prices last
year. The state's largest two utilities can't pay for their power.
     ``It's pretty clear that the state has no particular interest
in resolving this,'' Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling said
in an interview with Bloomberg News. ``It makes for good political
fodder, and so I think they'll spend a lot of time making a lot of
noise about it.''
     Several other energy companies praised the judge's
recommendations.
     ``We agree with the judge's position that the $8.9 billion
refund number is totally unsubstantiated,'' Duke Energy Corp.
spokesman Tom Williams said.
     PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
investor-owned utilities, ran up more than $14 billion in debt
buying electricity last year. The state stepped in and began
buying power for them in January, and has spent more than $7
billion.




California Governor Casts Blame for Crisis, to His Benefit
2001-07-13 03:03 (New York)

California Governor Casts Blame for Crisis, to His Benefit

     San Francisco, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor
Gray Davis's popularity is bouncing back, and pollsters credit the
Democratic lawmaker's campaign to blame the state's energy
problems on out-of-state power companies.
     Davis has criticized Duke Energy Corp., Enron Corp. and other
power sellers as price gougers since January. This week, Davis
used a power-plant opening as a platform to claim that energy
sellers are ``bleeding us dry.'' The Democratic state attorney
general and Democratic-controlled state Senate are investigating
the firms for market manipulation.
     The governor is winning support because of his attacks. A Los
Angeles Times poll in June showed that 86 percent of Californians
believed power generators distorted prices. Davis's approval
rating rose to 52 percent of registered voters in June, from 46
percent in early April, his lowest since being elected in 1998,
his pollster, Paul Maslin, found.
     ``Gray Davis is very good at licking his fingers and seeing
which way the political winds blow,'' said Bruce Cain, a political
science professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
``And he's found good villains.''

                    Outlook for Settlement

     The politics may make it harder for the state to reach a
settlement with energy companies for claims they overcharged the
state by $8.9 billion, analysts say. A federal judge overseeing
settlement talks said the state is owed far less. Davis says the
state will sue for $18 billion if its demands aren't met.
     ``There is no way you are going to get any kind of agreement
from someone making such audacious claims,'' said Donato Eassey,
an energy analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in Houston.
     The refunds may be secondary to Davis's effort to be re-
elected in 2002, a victory that political analysts say position
him as a contender for national office in 2004.
     ``He's in good shape going into 2002, and if he wins, there's
the inevitable speculation about whether he eyes a run for
president in 2004,'' Cain said.
     Just months ago, Davis's public approval ratings were at
their lowest point since he was elected, according to a Field
Institute poll in April.
     PG&E Corp.'s utility, the state's largest, was in bankruptcy.
Wholesale-power prices were rising, and millions of Californians
lost power in a string of blackouts caused by reduced power
reserves.

                         Governor Rebounds

     The governor was widely criticized for failing to act swiftly
to end the crisis. Now Davis seems to be recovering, analysts
said.
     While vilifying the power companies, the first-term governor
has also been spearheading the state's response to the energy
crisis. He has created a team to negotiate a financial rescue
package to save Edison International's Southern California Edison
utility from bankruptcy, started an $800 energy conservation drive
and pushed for more power plants to be built.
     The energy companies lashed back at Davis this week. A
spokesman for Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader,
accused Davis and California leaders of conducting a political
``witch hunt.''
     ``The last thing they want to do is take responsibility for
the problem they created,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.
``They set about looking for the biggest villains.''
     Enron filed suit against a California state Senate committee
investigating allegations of market manipulation, accusing the
panel and its Democratic chairman in a letter of seeking a
``scapegoat'' for a failed deregulation law.

                   Plotting his Response

     Davis began plotting his response to the crisis almost
immediately after it became public in January, said Garry South,
his chief political strategist. Step one, Davis aides said, was to
blame the energy companies that were profiting from the state's
woes. Davis targeted a half-dozen companies. In addition to Enron
and Duke, Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy Inc., and Williams Cos.
were placed in the crosshairs.
     ``There was a group of perpetrators from out of state
manipulating this system and screwing consumers,'' South said.
``We had to explain how this thing happened.''
     Republicans criticize Davis for inaction on the crisis, while
acknowledging he is favored to win re-election going into next
year's campaign.
     He leads three potential rivals -- Secretary of State Bill
Jones, banker William Simon, the son of former Treasury Secretary
William Simon, and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,
according to the Times poll of 1,541 state residents conducted
June 23-26.
     ``He will be the favorite,'' said Rob Stutzman, a consultant
for the California Republican Party.

                         Worries Ahead

     Davis still has worries as the state struggles to address the
energy crisis, analysts say.
     PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy in
April. Edison International's Southern California Edison, the No.
2 utility, is struggling to overcome legislative opposition to the
financial-rescue package negotiated by Davis.
     Davis may be blamed, analysts say, if the state Legislature
refuses to ratify the rescue plan for Edison and the utility files
for bankruptcy. Republicans and many Democrats in the Legislature
oppose the agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding.
     ``The MOU's dead, and the likely scenario is for the utility
is to go into bankruptcy,'' said Peter Navarro, an associate
professor of economics and public management at the University of
California at Irvine.
     California voters may receive unpleasant reminders of the
crisis all summer. The state has already suffered through six days
of rolling blackouts, and more are predicted.
     ``As soon as the lights go out, it's Gray's fault,'' Navarro
said.

""Following the sale of the 2000 peakers to Allegheny and the two 99 peakers

Managing Director (trading and risk management)
Enron North America

I started in Calgary in 1995, building our Canadian natural gas and
electrical power trading operation from scratch, and I left as president. It
was absolutely awesome. I had the time of my life. I hired the people I
wanted, with very little supervision, back when gas and power trading was in
its infancy, and today we're the biggest market maker and risk manager
there. These days, as many people know, we're using that same expertise to
create liquid markets in many other products, from broadband capacity to
paper pulp. So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in
Canada-to help build revolutionary new businesses.

But what some people might not realize is that even in our established gas
and power trading operations-where we're by far the dominant player-it's
hugely interesting and complicated, with a million variables to figure out,
from the weather to the available storage capacity in Montana. You can't
ship natural gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like
other commodities. And it's not like trading bonds, where you sit around
waiting for the Fed. If you like solving incredibly complex problems, and
you're very good at it ... get down here! We need you!


<JOHN'S CALLOUT QUOTE>
Enron's not a place where you can hide-or where you'll be hidden. If you
can't get it done, you won't fit in. But if you can, and you work hard,
you'll get noticed, you'll excel, you'll get paid, and we're going to love

Here is a working draft of the gas issues/diversion/penalties, etc. paper.  
Becky is working on the interstate pipeline tariffs and we will insert them, 
and Jeff Hidge will be sending something out about ENA legal issues, which I 
will add in.  I am also going to work on this tonite, to make the individual 
LDC diucssions follow a common template.  However, I wanted you to have 
something to look at before the meeting tomorrow morning.  I still have a 
couple of LDCs to add.  Thanks.

Total NYISO MWh for use in the denominator of your ratio share computations
are as follows:

March 2001:    13,677,199 MWh
July 2000:     14,144,257 MWh
August 2000:   14,854,861 MWh

A short-cut to computing your monthly MWh is to divide your total ""fixed""

                                         Adjustment Invoices




The NYISO will be posting invoices later today for the initial settlements
of July 2001 and the 1st settlement adjustments of July 2000, August 2000,
& March 2001.  Transmission Customers will observe the following
adjustments to their settlements.

Adjustments have been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to recover
the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside of the
billing process and to adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero
for each month invoiced.

Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of
forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and  the costs actually incurred
by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an over-collection which is being returned to Customers through an
adjustment to their monthly balances.  This billing treatment for July 2000
and August 2000 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market
totaling $7,700,605.23 and $32,146,310.55, respectively.  Customers where
paid their share of these adjustments based upon their respective ratio
shares of NYISO load for each month.  This adjustment provides for the
settlement of all accounts in the market in the month(s) the costs or
over-collections were realized and adjusts the NYISO clearing account
balance impact to zero for each month.

Adjustments have also been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to
recover the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside
of the billing process.  These adjustments totalled $964,548.42 for March
2001, $375,110.49 for July 2000 and $48,973.41 for August 2000. Customers
where allocated their share in these costs based upon their respective
ratio shares of NYISO load for each month.

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing. 

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart. 

Thanks 

Louise

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

1827,"
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Hope you're enjoying Houston.  The weather is probably alot better than it is here.  (big surprise!)

I'm a little concerned about the CP names in CAPS.  Today when I was looking at the GenSchedules for 4/30/01, there were a few CP names that were different from prior days.  ""HARBOR"" came across as ""HARBORCOG"" and ""SierraPowe"" came across as ""SIERRAPWR.""  This is only an issue b/c our lookup tables search for specific names.  I do not understand why names are changing in CAPS to their names in Enpower.  If you could look into this and let me know if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.

Dear Kay,

Confirming our discussion, The Texas Lawyer has asked King & Spalding to
organize a Roundtable Discussion of lawyers and business people to discuss
how the two professions relate to each other in the context of complex
business transactions.

The Roundtable would take place privately in a conference room in our
offices with a court reporter recording the discussion, which would then be
published in an upcoming issue of the newspaper. Participants will have the
opportunity to edit their remarks before they are published. John Cogan
will
be co-chairman of the proceedings with our partner, Chris LaFollette.  I
unfortunately cannot attend as I will be out of town.

The Discussion will take place on Thursday, March 15, from 2 to 3:30. We
will hold a planning session over lunch in one of our conference rooms from
12:30 to 2. No other preparation would be required.

You would be a terrific representative from Enron to join us and provide
Enron's perspective. Please confirm your attendance as soon as you get the
internal approvals by calling John Cogan at 713.276.7371 or by e-mail at
jcogan@kslaw.com.

Best regards,
John

The Contract Price for the Second Transaction in this short description will be the midpoint of the bid and offer price(s) on the Website for the second product listed in the short description at the time of the Transaction if both the bid and offer prices are then available or the available price if only one of such prices is then available. The Contract Price for the First Transaction will be the Contract Price used for the Second Transaction, modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the Website.
The Spread Transaction shall mean the ERCOT Transaction together with the ERCOT N 2001Transaction.  The Spread Seller and the Spread Buyer agree that the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction shall be treated as separate transactions under any applicable agreement(s) governing such transactions.  Accordingly, for example, if a party fails to perform under the ERCOT Transaction, the other party is not excused from performance under the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction based on such non-performance.  However, unless otherwise expressly defined, the term ""transaction"" as used on the Website shall mean each of the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction.  The ERCOT Transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") at Seller's daily election. If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.  The ERCOT N 2001 transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the North 2001 Zone as finalized pursuant to the action on April 17, 2001 by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") Board of Directors, at Seller's daily election. If such North 2001 Zone is superceded by a zone or zones of different boundaries, Seller shall nevertheless be required, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, to deliver the energy to points within the geographical area coextensive with the originally defined North 2001 Zone.  If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').

Hello to the Direct Access Coalition:

Below you will find a summary of the press strategy that Edelman Public
Relations intends to employ over the coming weeks in collaboration with the
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and the broader Direct Access Coalition.
I will also outline the information that I need from Direct Access Coalition
members who are willing to be involved in media outreach and interviews.
And finally, I have attached supporting documents that you can use as
background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that
you may receive.

This Week

1.   We are drafting a ""pitch letter"" to send out by the end of this week
via blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corps
reporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)
trade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Our
pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&I
customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are
suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will
address the effect on California's future business climate if direct access
is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x
caused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no
matter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a
part of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate
California businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a
prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.

2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access
Coalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press
strategy outlined here.

3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to
take media calls on behalf of the coalition.

Next Week

1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.

2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an
opportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.
Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be
effective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sending
a media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after
the hearing.

3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.

4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California
Capitol Week and the California Report) to secure
media interviews.

5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of
the amended language in SB 27x.

 What We Need From You

1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have
customers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please
respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact
information.

2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers
on behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to
do this for the you.

3.  If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with the
media it would be helpful to have this information so that we can
collaborate as necessary.

>  All documents are works in progress, so if you have suggestions on
> potential changes, please feel free to share them with us.

1850,"Hi John,

I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.  Let me take a look at the agreements 
first, before we commit.  Did Bob Carter work on these agreements?  He might 
have copies, and he won't charge us for them.  At least I don't think he will.

Thanks for your understanding and patience this week.

Subject: Re: Coal stuff  

I hope everything is going OK.

With Kathleen's help and Jeff Hodge's review the CA went out on Wednesday via 
email to BPUB.  Mitch and I are reviewing the TEX/MEX agreements to determine 
an appropriate commercial structure with the intent of preserving as much of 
the ""legalese"" in the original agreements (i.e., the development agreement 
and the participation agreement) as possible.  Our major concern is to keep 
this off Balance Sheet.  

 I'll call B &P to see if they have electronic versions.  Would you consider 
having Aaron Roffwarg of B & P work on this agreement, he was previously 
involved in the drafting of the agreements and he knows all of the players 
and their habits.

You mentioned that you feel like we can use Tex-Mex as a go-by.  Do you have 
electronic copies of the development agreement?

1855,"Phil,
I agree with your assessment, but would offer some additional information.; 
After returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell 
had;received a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possible 
meeting with them, I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday.; The 
strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California 
""political/lawyer"" type;who would have the necessary contacts to get us in 
there and get the permits moving.; Lou agreed and we have been working on 
that strategy while gathering more information related to the ""right"" contact 
that could get this job done.; I personally have had lengthy discussions 
(Thursday and Friday) with Lou, Larry Campbell, Bill Kendrick and several key 
consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and 
California.;We are closing in on a;local law firm and also a ""high level;air 
consultant"";who will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief 
level;to present (1) our;situation, (2) clean air needs for Arizona and CA, 
and (3) how long these permits have already been on file.; We should have 
someone identified early this next week.; 
;
Let me present the following information to;complement yours:
* ;The permitting timeline;being used;was based on historical 
timelines;encountered;while processing prior Arizona projects.; No indication 
of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning.; A familiar consultant 
(Argent);was used for the air permit applications and no indication was 
offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not 
occurring.; Applications filed in March, 2001 and by letter from the agencies 
were deemed complete by mid-April.
* Within the last two weeks, the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to the 
applications for Station 1 and 2 has stated that he is overloaded and working 
on the applications as they are in the ""que"".; He told Larry Campbell (and I 
have verified;it also by talking to outside consultants that permit in 
Arizona) that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in 
getting permits out. (Caveat: One of the suggestions we want to carry in to 
AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a third-party contractor to 
take the permits and work them up;for release to the publishing firm so they 
can be sent out for public comment.; AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us and 
discuss our applications.);; Even if we get this part going, this is only 
part of the problem.; Bottom line is;we must play our cards;correctly at this 
juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que, typed, and 
out for public comment; but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after 
that for their review of those two state issued permits.
* EPA Region IX is a different story.; It is most difficult to put pressure 
on them, more so than AZ DEQ.; The applications for Stations 3 and 4 are on 
tribal land and these;applications are not delegated to any state air quality 
department.;;After the technical meetings in the office last week, Larry made 
a couple of calls;to the Permit Engineer;in Region IX and received a negative 
response.; Larry was told that the;permits would issue in one to four months 
and that;there was no need for a meeting with them.; Again,;my advice at this 
point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high 
level and get the meeting set.; It's one thing to pressure the State of 
Arizona and get a permit applications moving; but if we are not very careful 
with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devil's 
permits, but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching.; 
Again, we must first get a personal meeting with them;to enable us to 
present;the need, circumstances, and how long these permits have already been 
on file.; Locating the;correct person to help us do that is of upmost 
importance!
* Clarifying the complicated point, EPA Region IX has responsibility 
to;review and publish not only the permits for Stations 3 and 4, but to also 
review the AZ DEQ permits for stations 1 and;2 for 30 days.; Therefore, if we 
anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations;3 and 4, they could delay the 
issuance of the permits for Stations 1 and 2 that;have been expedited with 
the AZ DEQ.; It's a two-edged sword.
Our Strategy:
* Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers, but very 
carefully.; Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them.
* Locate a political/lawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ 
and EPA Region IX to help us get the;desired meeting with key;people in order 
to;move;the permits.; This should be done within the next week.
* Offer to assist in any manner (e.g., funding a third party) to get the 
permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comment.
I have some strategic ideas that will increase the;probability that this type 
of circumstance will not occur in the future.; I will be glad to discuss any 
of this with you on Monday morning.; John Shafer

Here is the problem.; Apparently the matter was further discussed at the

* Sun Devil is a bird in the bush and Red Rock is a bird in the hand. 
* There is no way that we can get the Red Rock project completed as promised 
because we waited until it was too late to find out what was going on with

A few things:

1.  Apologies for not answering your message sooner but I have just returned 
this week after a few weeks of vacation - and your e-mail (together with 
about 300 others ) have only just arrived on my PC today owing to a glitch 
which occurred with my machine whilst I was away.

2.  I have finished the due diligence on this - the first round was completed 
some months ago and preliminary results were given to Mark Haedicke and Harry 
Arora - not to Gary as I never knew that he was involved.  Out of that first 
round of due diligence several questions arose which required to be bottomed 
out and despite instructing Indian counsel in April on those additional 
questions, they never actuallly finalised their advice on this aspect until a 
few days before I went on vacation.  Anyway, that has now been done.

3.  I'm starting my secondment in Houston for two months from next Monday.  
As I am trying to sort out things here today and tomorrow in preparation for 
my absence from London, would you mind if  I gave you the full low-down on 
this one early next week, face-to face??

Kind regards

Mark

Have you spoken with Gary Hickerson about your findings re: India? He was 
asking me today about the status of our due diligence review and asked if I 
could be his point person with respect to this exercise. Could you pls 
email/mail me any further correspondence re: India? Also maybe we could have 
a quick chat tomorrow as to what your conclusions are at this point regarding 
trading in India. 

Many thanks,

Subject: Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India

Mark, 

Further to my e-mail to you of last week on the above subject, I have now 
reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local 
Indian Counsel (Crawford Bailey & Co.) on the above topic in January 1997.  
That due diligence reveals the following:

Prior Reserve Bank of India (""RBI"") approval required to do business in 
India:  If  Enron is considered to be ""doing business in India"" (which it 
would, for example, if we had a branch or entity there) we shall require the 
prior consent of the  RBI under Section 29 (1) (a) Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act 1973 (""FERA"") e.g. to set up the branch or entity.  Please 
note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel (14th January, 
1997), Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any 
conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain 
approval from the RBI to do business in India.  This needs to be revisited as 
to the requirements.

Repatriation of proceeds / Exchange Control:  Please note that in the 
approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI, such approval would 
state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated e.g., to 
the USA, or not.  I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate 
and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it.  We also 
need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation.  

FX / Interest Rate dealings:

A. It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate 
Products for the Enron Group (i.e., an internal Treasury Desk) to trade with 
dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with 
either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the 
RBI.  

B. FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and 
would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by 
the FERA.  Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the 
general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically 
approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA.  It is not 
clear what are the exact ramifications of  dealings in contravention of FERA; 
this needs to be investigated. 

C. What are the Rules of FERA (see A above)?  It appears that the RBI 
requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are 
actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying 
transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their 
exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates, and authorised 
dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are 
firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated 
deals.   The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the 
dealer.   It appears, however, that there was a relaxation of the Rules 
shortly before the 1997 due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised 
dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to 
corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a back-to-back 
basis without seeking the approval of the RBI.  These transactions are the 
following:

1. Interest Rate Swaps.

2. Currency Swaps.

3. Coupon Swaps.

4. Purchase of Interest Rate CAPS/Collars.

5. Forward rate agreements.

 In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers 
are required to ensure that:

(i) The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying 
loan transactions.

(ii) The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the 
outstanding amount of the loan.

(iii) The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to 
maturity of the underlying loan

(iv)  The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved (a once and 
for all basis is sufficient) the relevant financial limits and the authorised 
designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions.

Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of 
underlying ""loan"" transactions.  Hence query, e.g., whether a simple currency 
swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual 
underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption - and if not, query how one 
obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this.  This needs to be 
investigated.  If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall 
need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a 
transaction.   

Speculative transactions are void:  Please note that transactions entered 
into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section 30 of 
the Indian Contract Act 1872.  Indian counsel opines that provided the rate 
or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or 
protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid. 

Capacity and Authority: It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that 
the transactions were covered by its objects' clause and similarly that our 
counterparties' objects' clauses covered the products in which we wish to 
deal - there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside 
their capacity.  Furthermore, in relation to authority to enter into 
transactions, it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron 
officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or 
Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties' 
documentation in this regard.  

Derivatives and Borrowings:  If we were to establish a company in India, we 
would be subject to the Companies Act 1956 in relation to limitation on the 
quantum of monies which it could borrow.   Any borrowing in excess of 
stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the 
company in general meeting.  Accordingly, in relation to derivatives' 
transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency, one 
would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by 
the members of the company in general meeting. The power to borrow itself, 
must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors. 

Collateral: It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided / 
received, for example, in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master 
Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India, would be legal, 
valid and binding, as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its 
insolvency; however, the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge, 
pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance.  The due 
diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due 
diligence consider outright transfers of collateral (e.g., under English law) 
rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral 
situated locally in India;  these issues need to be checked. 

Choice of Law and Arbitration:  It would appear that Indian entities may 
enter into agreements (e.g., ISDA Masters) governed by New York or US law and 
it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work.

Insurance business:  Indian counsel opined that interest rate/FX derivative 
transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India.

Income Tax:  Please note that if an Enron entity, or a branch of an Enron 
entity, was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake 
such business, then any income arising to the Enron entity / branch in India 
from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax.  Please 
note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA, UK and 
Singapore with India.  However, no details of rates of taxation or further 
explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in 
the opinion.

Gross-Up Clauses:  Contractual gross-up clauses re withholdings (e.g., the 
standard gross-up clause in the ISDA Master) would need to be approved by the 
RBI.  Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved. 

Close-out netting:  Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA 
Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel, the existing due 
diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator 
or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim 
unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum 
(e.g., if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a close-out against 
them in their insolvency).  This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel.

Oral Contracts:  Please note that in relation to oral contracts, whilst it is 
possible to sue upon an oral contract in India, it is not possible to take 
any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the 
permission of the RBI under section 47 of FERA.  Indian counsel does not 
state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to 
obtain. 


Mark, I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above 
before I take any further action on the above.

Kind regards

Mark


Apart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a branch or a 
subsidiary in India, and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the 
US any proceeds of such business, there did not appear to be any other trade 
control or other laws which would inhibit Enron's ability to do business in 
India.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

David Cantor

1859,"Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank 
into their own subdirectory called ""Swap Forms"" (look it up just like a 
person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database 
from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't 
know if you can access other subdirectories.

We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit 
Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a 
comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined 
forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now 
located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms 
directory.

Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may 
already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up.

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Larry Doyle

Chris,  I think we already discussed this issue but let me summarize what I think happened:

we were parking 50 mw's with COB.   We sold 50 to Reliant/HLP,  but the transmission got cut.    3 mw's flowed on Oasis 9337 to Reliant.    We show in the system that we are purchasing 50 mw's from COB and selling them 47.
So,  I dont think that we needed to bookout 3 mw's with HLP.    They received 3 mw's from City of Bryan on deal #625291. 
You entered a bookout purchase on deal #625352.

Oasis also  shows that 3 mw's flowed on #9337.   So once again,  we have an extra purchase from HLP that we didnt need.
Did you negotiate this with HLP?   
Is this what happened?

I'll talk to you about this tonight.

Thanks,  MW

Kay,  you bring up an excellent point.  We have addressed this issue in at 
least two of the form contracts that I am familiar with; however, I believe 
only recently. See Section 7.5 of our Dedicated Reserves Form Contract  
provides: 

"".......Buyer shall not disclose ......to any third party(other than the 
Party's and its affiliates' employees, lenders, counsel, accountants or 
prospective purchasers of any contract rights, general intangibles or 
accounts hereunder,[ it does not say this in our current form, however I 
would suggest considering  adding here ""whether in an asset sale , financing 
or equity transaction""] in each case who have agreed to keep such terms 
confidential"")...................

Sec tion 8.8 of the Enfolio Master Purchase / Sale (natural Gas) form 
contract contains a similar provision.

I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality 
hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.  In 
short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to 
potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our 
forms allow this.

I'm trying to include an exception for ""potential lenders and investors"" 
whenever I can (instead of just lenders). Does someone have a more artful or 
effective solution?  

Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the 
issue.

Right now, the plant is down and gas being purchased under contract is out of the money.  Joe Parks is reselling the gas that was scheduled going into the month to TXU and isn't dealing (yet) with the imbalance that was carried forward as a result of prior months' activity.  Ideally, he would cut back scheduled gas and start working off the imbalance.  Did we ever get a read on the PPEP supply/transport contracts in terms of flexibility to meet contract mins?

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Subject: Ongoing Dabhol Task Force calls, starting Wednesday, January 10

We will continue to have a daily Dabhol Task Force Call primarily aimed to 
update the working group team with participation by senior management as they 
deem appropriate. All of you are invited to participate. You may find that 
until major events occur, participating everyday is not useful. Thus, when 
major updates occur, we will send a separate e-mail requesting that all be on 
the phone call. However, all team members working directly on this project 
are expected to attend everyday.

On Wednesday, January 10, we will be discussing outcome of lender meetings in 
New York. 

To assist the India team with finishing our daily meetings and returning back 
to the office or perhaps even allowing time for people to get home before the

Richard-
 
Good luck on your company's adventure.  I  can't think of a better person to direct Enron's defense.  You will be  happy to know we turned down an untruthful proxy statement,  1933, and 1934 act  case.  (Actually, you probably wish a nit-wit like me got the  cases.)

1890,"AFAC and Marcelo:  I hope this message finds you both well.  I would like to 
finalize the matrix which was prepared last year so that we can create a 
""baseline"" for future updates.  Please feel free to date the matrix as of 
December, 1999, if you wish.  Please forward any recent changes to me for 
comment  and I will respond immediately.  Then we can move on to other 
things!  Thanks for your help and attention to this mattter.  Regards.  Sara

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like 
to
finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to 
think
that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect
to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or
can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara

Subject: TD volumes

Jon: I'm attaching TD's volumes (in GJs) for swap 1 with Enron Canada.  The 
fixed price is $5.983.  Just to be clear, these are how the volumes add up:
12/29/2000 422,002 GJ
03/29/2001 422,002 GJ
06/29/2001 422,002 GJ
90/27/2001 25,058,472 GJ

Jeff: can you size up the fixed price for the swap between ENA and Chase to 
reflect your spread on the above volumes?

John:  you can use the same volumes, but at the price you get from Jeff 
(which you will pass on to Enron Canada in our internal swap).

I will e-mail you RBC's volumes as soon as I confirm that they have locked in 
an interest rate (their volumes will be slightly different from TD's).  
Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,
-Catherine

Dear Rick:

As a follow-up to my voicemail message today just before 5PM, I am sending this email with additional details, including a track of earlier descriptive communications.

Please advise regarding the specific request for legal assistance addressing the Florida Sunshine laws.  Please let me know if you would address the request, or if we should proceed with local Florida counsel.

As additional background, Mike Nelson, VP under Phil Lowry,  is heading an initiative for security of the ETS related pipelines.  Enron Corp. security personnel are also participating as a service to ETS.

Selected communications on this matter will be held as confidential.  

Thank you.

The email you forwarded from Rob Wilson included the following request:

In discussions with Lou and Colleen, we concluded that I would check with Rick Shapiro, Counsel for Legislative Affairs, to address the request.  Alternatively, we can seek assistance from local Florida counsel (e.g. Ann Longman in Tallahassee FL).  

I will let you know what develops soon.

Also, I understand that Rob Wilson is Manager of Regional Governmental Affairs in Tallahassee.  He mentioned that he had a prepared presentation that he had already used. Perhaps we should consider asking him to begin routing written matters on security through you and me for the time being.  Please ask him for a copy of the presentation before the conference call.  I assume we will meet in advance of the 10/24 call too.

Thank you.

Mike,

Richard Hixson, House staff and Sue  Skelton, Senate staff have requested a meeting w/ our security rep. on the 24th. I suggested a conference call, since the same individual will be the presenter on the 26th. A time has not been established for the call. The conference call would include Sue, Richard , and the House and Senate chairs of each committee, Dudley Goodlette and Ginny Brown -Waite respectively. The intent would be to brief this audience on current security practices on the pipe and initiatives we are participating in w/ other stakeholders i.e. INGAA, DOE, OPS etc... In addition, the chairs want to be aware of information we do not want to share and how to manage the committee Q and A.

 I have indicated the 26th presentation will be succinct, generic, but reassuring . We can manage the Q and A  w/ some general responses regarding our efforts w/ the Florida Law Enforcement Department and heightened state of awareness responses.

 A side item- beyond the committees interest in hearing from our security personnel, Sue has asked if  an attorney in our group could assist her in drafting language, if needed, to provide exemptions/protections to FL sunshine laws regarding security related documents. 

FYI- I have a presentation, I'll be using Monday w/ our PSC which includes bullet points on reliability and security, which should satisfy our needs for the 26th.

This is something we can do, but it will be at a very high level in terms of specific information shared. 

I suggest we have a confernce call on this next week (or before) to 1.) determine what the Florida House and Senate is expecting, 2) who should attend, and 3.) who else is invited. 

I will be out of pocket until next Monday, but could possibly call in if the timing was right.

Mike,

This morning legislative staff asked that I arrange for the appearance of an ETS security personality to address the House and Senate committees examining FL security issues. The committees tentatively plan to meet jointly on October 26th to discuss infrastructure security. There also will be a prehearing meeting on the 25th w/ committee leadership, to discuss the presentations. 

The hearing schedule and agenda continues to be a work in progress as legislative members and staff prepare for a special session to begin on Monday. However, I wanted to alert you to the possibility of needing someone from your shop on at least the 26th. I have seen most everything we've produced to date regarding this issue and drafting a statement will be relatively straight forward. As is always the case, it is the committee Q and A where the practitioner is most helpful.

I will keep you informed of any developments, my contact numbers are 850-350-5018 office;  850-544-6938 cell; 850-668-2782 home

1898,"ILA: Initiating Coverage of a Pure-Play Energy Merchant

* We initiate coverage of Aquila, Inc. with a 1H (Buy, High Risk)
rating and a 12-month price target of $44.
* Aquila is a pure-play Energy Merchant, leveraging their strong
trading and risk management skills in the rapidly growing energy commodity
markets.  Aquila was an early mover into these deregulating markets, and has
shown strong traction over recent years, which we believe is sustainable
long-term.
* We project a 20-25% growth rate for ILA driven by our robust outlook
for wholesale energy and the potential for successful expansion into new
commodities and geographies.
* At a 2002 0.7x P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio, ILA is trading at a
significant discount to their Energy Merchant peer average of 1.0x. Based on
its strong track record and potential for industry-leading earnings growth,
we place a PEG value on ILA of 1.0x 2002 earnings, leading to our $44 price
target.

Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.  They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.

To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.

All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.  Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.  The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.  I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.  I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.

Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.  If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical. 

Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.  So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.

Regards

John Cummings

1903,"Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. 
Critical Business Application:
Outlook (Exchange Servers)
Mailman.Enron.com
Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total)
EDI Hub
EDI Net
VPN
PGas
TMS
CMS
CRS
 	
Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification:
Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building.
Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging).
Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors.
Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland.
EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method.

Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts.

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 500MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the Ontario government re market opening. You will recall that this was something we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, following Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a term sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap structure. 

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September readiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a position that one LDC  could halt market opening.

1922,"The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.  Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.

It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.  Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.

Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to  your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?

1932,"I have been called by Simon Rosenberg at the NDN.  He said that things are 
deteriorating for many of his members who want to take a balanced approach on 
the crisis.  He said their internal polling have energy issues and their 
impact on the environment on thee top of the priority list in the New Dem 
districts.  Simon reported the surge in interest in energy is shocking.  He 
said Lieberman may have come out early in support of price caps and 
investigations...but others may follow.  

Chuck Alston with the DLC called the same day to tell me that they are 
hearing similar concerns from several New Democrats and Chuck said they may 
be pushed into supporting cost-of-service-based rate making.  He and Will 
Marshall REALLY do not want to do this. I told him that we would oppose this 
and that we wanted to work with them to find other solutions.

Note that the NDN is hosting an energy event in late June where we will be 
listed as co-host as an executive committee member.  I told Megan that making 
it a fundraiser was not a good idea, instead make it a membership recruitment 
event.

NDN is planning an energy industry breakfast for June 21st at the AGA.  We
have several Members of Congress on board and are pushing to get at least
one Senator.  There has been some debate on how to do this event.  We're
wavering between couching it as a NDN members only event (hence making it a
fundraiser) or we can open it to all energy companies (hence making it a
prospecting event.)  I thought I would run this by you and get your thoughts
on it.  Any feedback you can give would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

darling boy-

i'm never mad at you, never ever, and i really do adore you to death and
forever and can't bear the idea that we wouldn't be friends till death do
us
part, and that i wouldn't be welcome in your life, so no, i was never mad
and don't even remember which of my (many) soliloquoys you may have
interrupted or are referring to but i do know that i have a rather
boisterous personality and perhaps i stepped on your toes and this is not
my
intention and i adore you and my company is about to go under so the idea
of
being unemployed AND having you upset with me is far too much for my
delicate self to handle...

We are in the process of selling (transitioning) the Projects piece of the GSA Region 1 Deal to Enron Facility Services, with the commodity piece to remain the responsibility of EES. We would like to confirm that when EFS completes a project, the resulting reduced consumption figures will not adversely affect your commodity risk position.

Please indicate your acceptance of this transaction by responding to this email.

1947,"To All:

Recently, Mark asked me to focus efforts on putting together a technology 
plan for the Legal Department.  Attached for your information is a draft of 
the proposed plan.

As you will see, the central goal of the plan is to enhance our position as 
essential members of the business team by providing - through the 
implementation of available technology tools  - efficient means of enabling 
our clients to meet their business objectives.  The plan attempts to meet 
this overall goal through three different, but related phases, each of which 
can be implemented independently.  Timing of implementation and dedication of 
resources have not been formally addressed as the plan is only in its infant 
stages; however, it is Mark's goal to rapidly move forward with certain 
portions of the plan.

It is my understanding that a meeting will be scheduled for next week some 
time to review and discuss the proposed plan.  Prior to that meeting, if any 
of you should have any comments, questions or ideas, please do not hesitate 
to let me know your thoughts.

Subject:	Meeting you would be interested in

I am forwarding emails relevant to the Team Ranger initiative from the time I became involved to the time the scope of the effort was limited.  My understanding from my notes and recollections and a discussion with Glen Matthys this morning is as follows:
*  Team Ranger is co-sponsored by Greg Young, Scott Mills, and Mary Lynn Ruffer.
*  Team Ranger's objective is to capture all the data necessary for Ruffer to provide flash reports to Mills on what should liquidated from the risk book  vs actual costs and revenues experienced; Young's involved because his Operations group provides the link to CSC's billing and invoicing systems.
*  Since I had been discussing my forecasting data needs and RPS tie-ins with Scott, he viewed this as an opportunity for the organization to gather more information than strictly needed to meet this objective and invited me to lobby for an expanded scope.
*  Clearly I was outvoted, since the subsequent scope was severely restricted to retrieving only the financial data that is readily available to CSC and which will enable flash report development quickly (for power only); an expanded scope would have compromised timely deliverables.
*  The system will pull down monthly data from STAT and LodeStar billing systems on a daily frequency (and will still provide some valuable information for me).
*  The data collected for Team Ranger will be housed in an Enron-controlled database (not CSC's), supposedly for easy access to Enron users.


Chris, this clearly falls in the realm we were discussing last night -- a limited scope ""silo"" initiative to solve a localized problem.  Like I said, I'm a culprit, too -- if no one else wants to provide the data I need, I'll pull it myself just as you counseled a month ago when we were struggling to get answers from CSC (via Operations). I admit you were right: we've gotten more data since then with access privileges than I could have wrangled out of requests to CSC in six months (despite California).

Let me know what else you need from me to facilitate your efforts.  Please keep me updated with what you learn and where we stand.  I'll do the same.

There is a meeting scheduled for Monday (see below) to discuss information that must be provided by CSC and Avista so that we can start tying out what is actually billed to what is in the Risk books.  This is a lot of the same information that I know you are trying to get your hands around.  If you are interested in attending, please do so.  If you are not available, give me some data points so that nothing is overlooked.  This will be the first of many ""get togethers"".  Evan Hughes and his group will be there to represent what we are currently getting from the outsource providers as well as what we are collecting internally.

Subject:	Re: A/R Accruals Mtg. - Reminder   

After looking at this, a couple of thoughts:

Assuming that we will create a ""global"" repository that will support everyone's needs for all EES activity (purchases and sells)

	Internal as well as outsource data

Outsource data needs to be ""Enronized"" (consistent internal formatting of field values)

	We should be able to use the GCP/EES Settlement System cross reference mapping that is set up and maintained by Global Counterparty as a way to get 	to Enron's Global Counterparty number

This should be a daily feed

We will need the same information for payments

Additional information needed in the file:

EES Entity transacting Business
Commodity 			(e.g. power, gas)
Covered Service		(e.g. commodity, projects, AOPS)
Flow Begin Date
Flow End Date
Volume
Volume Frequency 		(e.g. daily, monthly, total for period)
Volume Status			(e.g. estimated, actual)
Price Type 			(e.g. Commodity, Tax, ...)
Rate Schedule 			(if applicable -e.g. Name of Utility Rate Class)
Rate Name 			(if applicable -e.g. IF-Transco/Z6 New York Restricted)
Pass Through Fee 		(Yes/No)
Price (Per Unit)/Rate  		(e.g. Per Unit $50.00 USD/MWH or Rate $100,000 USD)
Price Currency                                   (e.g. USD, CAD, etc.
Total Amount 			(Price * Volume)
Total Amount Currency		(e.g. USD, CAD, etc.

Joni -how different is the information in this file compared to what Mike Newlin is getting on a daily basis for the Credit Aggregation process.  Should what Mike is getting be coordinated with this process.  The one advantage that I can see now is the ability to get an aged open A/R Balance

Mary Lynne -is there any additional information from what you are having pulled now for reconciliation of prior months?

Michael -from your requirements that you are already discussing regarding volumes, is there anything else?

How different is this from the Tax Project extract that was discussed -can these efforts be consolidated?

I will have Christina schedule a meeting for further discussion.

Attached is the file you sent me with data elements that are important in volume forecasting highlighted and copied into its own column, then supplemented with additional information that would be useful if available from the sources contemplated.  Note the color codes used in highlighting are yellow to denote necessary or essential and blue to mark elements that ""would be nice or occasionally useful.""  Thanks, Pat, for your help in compiling this list.

 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Thursday, May 24, 2001           Dear Continental.com Customer,   We're Changing To Serve You Better  Next Wednesday evening, May 30, 2001, we are launching a new version of eService Online, the web reservations system on continental.com.  Once the new version is implemented, you will have access to new options and personalized features tailored to meet your travel needs. In order to make this transition, we ask that you carefully review and follow the suggestions listed below.   Here's What You Need To Know:  Your Profile Your profile information, including your username (gstorey) and password, has been transferred to the new version of eService Online. To protect your personal information, credit card information has not been transferred. You will need to update your profile.  Your Itineraries Information in your Saved Itineraries created on or before May 30 will not be transitioned.  If you want to keep a copy for your records, print them prior to 6 p.m. CDT, May 30. This change does not affect the status of any reservations and tickets, just your ability to view them in the new eService Online.   Signing In To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to reserve and purchase flights.  This means you will have to use your password each time.  To have your password e-mailed to you click here .  You are strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging process.   24 Hour Hold Option To prepare for next Wednesday's release, we will turn off the ""Hold for 24 hours"" option. The ""Hold"" option will not be available between May 25 and May 30.   Here Are Some of the Changes  More eTicketing The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets (eTickets). We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airlines (CO2000-2349).   Aircraft Seat Maps We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating.    Pricing  The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your selection of either ""Search By Lowest Fares"" or ""Search By Schedule."" We also added a gold star to denote ""continental.com promotional fares,"" so you know for certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare.    Customer Service  Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services.  While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new version may not, on the surface, appear to be significantly different.  These changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.  We're confident you will appreciate the changes and improvements and we look forward to continuing to serve you in the future.  Sincerely, Continental Airlines Inc.   This is an informational e-mail.  You have been sent this e-mail as a registered eService Online user to inform you of this change in service.

Pretty much correct.  Actual is:

Curry	$20,439,468
Sukaly	$0 (somehow 4 midmarketing deals I did got credited to Sukaly so I moved the $27,602 to me!)
Ahn	$12,181 (associate)
Jester	$10,000 (just started in group a couple of months ago)

Doug Gilbert-Smith supported me from the trading side to help get the wind deal done and he has been paid 50% of its value $18MM.  No one else was working with me on the wind deal other than support groups.  Portz in legal was instrumental in getting the contract done with Enron Wind.  Edith Cross and Greg Trefz in structuring also pulled long nights to get the deal approved.

Subject:	RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)


The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
>From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed   

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Subject: Stephen Bennett


Stephen Bennett, professional meteorologist, was hired into the Research 
group in September of this year as a Specialist based on salary alignment 
criteria.  In retrospect, and upon review, he should have been hired on as a 
Senior Specialist.

After coming on board. it rapidly became apparent that Stephen was clearly an 
""under hire.""  He is well-deserving of an immediate promotion (really more of 
a correction) and pay raise, to be made retroactive at least to the 1st of 
this month. This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring 
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive ""promotion.""

At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron 
designated as ""Professional Meteorologist.""  In fact, the most recent similar 
hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist, 
who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While 
functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job 
classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional 
professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the 
proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This original 
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist 
category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected 
at this time.

Although a ""new-hire"" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work 
experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the 
Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in 
Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations, 
needing no further training and only minimal supervision.

Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enron 
values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed 
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager 
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather 
briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparation 
as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly 
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a 
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through 
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.

Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  He 
designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research 
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather 
derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and 
liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion 
and major upgrade of this web page.

These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen,s regular 
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail, 
to assemble and prepare our trader,s weather report.  Recently, with the 
advent of extended hours for both NYMEX and EnronOnline, Stephen voluntarily 
on his own accord, assists in our new Sunday weather support effort.  As his 
supervisor, fully cognizant of his already standard 50+ hour work week, I do 
not solicit, but readily accept, this above and beyond expectations 
assistance.

In review, the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was 
Enron,s immediate need for a non-standard, fairly unique professional - a 
meteorologist, coupled with Stephen,s desire to work for our company in spite 
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional 
title reflecting his chosen career path..  Once hired, Stephen has clearly 
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well-deserving 
of this immediate and retroactive promotion.

"
1962,"Spoke with Ben Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that 
we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area. Can you prepare 
a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a 
meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically 
a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria 
and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that 
would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in 
economics and of course a skim. 

Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.  and 
proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a 
Friday (23) meeting.

Thanks, Rick

MN is finally accepting our money.  While pushing this issue a method was worked out with the Lender's counsel (both local and BP) to make simpler filings now as well as in the future.  All nine counties should be filed by the end of today.  
"
1967,"Cory Gordon concluded his examination on Friday.? Highlights: 

--The NSM/Pruessag Off-Take Agreements did not contain any tonnage and/or 
quality requirements. 

--Part of the offering proceeds ($3 million) were mysteriously paid to an 
entity called Rowlyn Investments.? The disbursement was approved by Shultes.? 
Nolan had no knowledge of the payment or the entity.

--NSM purchased its scrap from Suntech -- a company not surprisingly 
controlled by Swasdi. 

--Nolan learned of SDI's termination after the letter had been sent by 
Busse.? Nolan was surprised and shocked to see the letter.? Nolan believes 
that the plant can be salvaged and will ""make a lot of money for someone"" in 
the future.

Swartz began his examination late afternoon and tried to get Nolan focused on 
the two days prior to the Oct. 13 Bondholders' meeting.? Swartz asked Nolan 
about the source of the cash flow numbers presented to the bondholders.? 
Nolan generally deferred all questions concerning the cash/expenditure 
numbers to Stickler and Heasley.? Swartz did not ask questions about 
ECT/Enron although he did inquire whether Kevin McConville was generally 
accessible to Nolan.? Nolan stated that while he worked more closely with 
Stickler, Ari Levy and Heasly, McConville was responsive.

Michael Tomaino was the only defense counsel to ask questions.? Tomaino 
focused on the problems SDI had with its start up phase and the depressed 
nature of the East Asian steel market in 1998.? Nolan stated that the 
operational and quality problems NSM faced were identical to those faced by 
SDI during its start up.? Nolan also stated that, in his opinion, the 
depressed Asian market was to blame for NSM's demise.?

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Linda Helper

Subject: Producer meeting


The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a ""wet"" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and ""unwaive"" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being ""dry""  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it
 
Timing---  we said we would attempt to get back to them mid January--  
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call myself or Dave N.

Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the ""Notices"" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,

1980,"Rod and Tracy,

As a result of a state of Colorado audit TW has been assessed tax (+penalties and interest) for compressor fuel use ($.4mm), and on the purchase of a La Plata facility ($1.3mm). We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay
the compressor fuel use assessment (""under protest"") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.

We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.  
This payment would be a deferred expense until the protest is fully resolved.

Subject:	Commission Clarifies DA Suspension Decision--Requires Utilities to Accept DASRs for Facility Adds Under Contracts Signed Before 10.20.01

?	In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed ""Petitions for Rehearing.""
?	The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
?	Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
?	In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
?	Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
?	Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
?	The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
?	If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001.""  pp 20-21

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of ""zeros"" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.
