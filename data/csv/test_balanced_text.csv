3,1627,"Spoke with Ben Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that 
we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area. Can you prepare 
a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a 
meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically 
a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria 
and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that 
would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in 
economics and of course a skim. 

Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.  and 
proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a 
Friday (23) meeting.

Thanks, Rick",False

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Robert Stephenson",False

	The 138 MMBtu was cut @ Will County per conversation with our Gas
Transportation Services area.  Jeanette Trinidad of the area said ANR told
her when they tried to confirm the gas with Border @ Will County the lesser
number was confirmed.

Also, the 3,661 MMBtu cut for the 19th on Border contract R0259F will be
taken away from Peoples Gas.  Peoples will reduce its SIQ amount of 125,000
to 121,201 (3,661 + 138).

NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  ""Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season,"" says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  ""Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions.""

""Transmission systems in North America are also expected to perform
reliably,"" he added, ""although some transmission congestion is expected
during the course of the winter.""  According to the report, fuel
supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this
winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20
percent greater than the same time last year.

The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe
drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from
hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are
sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's
demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a
combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is
expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.

electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to ""keep the lights on"" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.",False

As you may have become aware, the company received notice yesterday that you have been named as defendants (along with Enron Corp., Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow, and Arthur Andersen) in one of the federal securities class actions.  I will forward to you a copy of the Complaint.  We are in the process of determining who would be the most effective counsel for you.  If you wish to have separate representation, please let me know.  I cannot guarantee that the D&O carrier will reimburse you for the cost of separate counsel.  

I am setting up a meeting with counsel for Enron Corp., Susman & Godfrey, to discuss this litigation with you as soon as possible.  Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions.

Steve, I attach a briefing paper for your visit. A hard copy will be 
available for you on arrival. The paper includes the following:
Itinerary
Conference details
Brattle paper summary
Media interview background
General key messages
Electricity wholesaling reactive statement
Political update
Meeting briefing notes




You will note one further change to the itinerary. We will be meeting with 
METI rather than the Fair Trade Commission. The purpose of the METI meeting 
will be to explain our concerns with the current regulatory environment and 
Enron Japan's proposal to temporarily suspend its electricity wholesaling 
activities. We met with our METI working level contacts today to brief them 
on Brattle and in particular the shortcomings of the current system. We did 
not discuss suspension of our wholesaling activities. The meeting briefing 
notes will be available on your arrival in Tokyo.


I also attach the latest version of the Brattle paper and, for completeness, 
the final version of the presentation and notes. 




I will call you at the Palace Hotel on Monday at 6pm. If you have any hiccups 
with arrangements please let me know. My contact numbers are as follows:

Home 813 52610539
Mobile 8190 27334795

make for an interesting visit for you. I look forward to seeing you on Monday.

38,3191,"1.  When you buy from the imbalance(Services 2mw for HE 17-22) please make sure that you buy from the correct zone(i.e.  if finals have sp load dec'd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp).  Day shift, assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for 3 hours they dec'd SP load.  Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED,  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a -2 for HE 17-22.  As always we don't want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want.

2.  Unless I have been informed incorrectly, we should be accounting for bloomberg fees as a fee rather than sticking it the price.  This should make the SAR and settlements just a little easier.",False

make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state.  
Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental 
quality in California.
That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are 
going outside the state to build power plants. 
Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the 
legislation passed yesterday tinkers.
Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to 
keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price 
spikes.
If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a 
dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will 
continue, or worsen.
California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now.

On the retail price cap
They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat 
them hear)
The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply 
puts off the day of reckoning.
It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your 
door to collect.
Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets 
because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a 
couple of years down the road.
So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same 
amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use 
electricity wisely.
There's a better answer:
Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with 
another retail provider.  
Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision 
makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals 
with companies like Enron.  But for the press reports, they hardly know 
there's a crisis.",False

As we discussed, attached is both a redlined and clean version of the Deloitte letter.  The redlined reflects the changes we have made to our form based upon the comments submitted by Deloitte.  The clean version incorporates the changes and can be used to finalize this matter, the only thing still needing to be completed is the name and address on the letter.

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)

     (Adds names of California generators in fifth paragraph, and
Reliant comment in sixth.)

     New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partial
payment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities this
summer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-door
meeting with the governor said.
     ``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the
companies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone,
a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meeting
in New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar.
That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.''
      PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
utilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12
billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices.
Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power-
buying debt to consumers.
     Davis said some generators have approached him with offers to
accept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utility
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35
analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York in
a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were
not allowed to attend.

                        No Names Mentioned

    Davis didn't specify which companies came to him with partial-
payment proposals, analysts said. Duke Energy Corp., Calpine
Corp., Willams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. are among
the biggest suppliers of electricity to California utilities.
    ``I'm not aware of him talking to anyone at Duke about
forgiveness,'' Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said.
      Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Davis's proposal
``doesn't really come as a surprise'' because politicians in
Sacramento, the capital of California, have been discussing the
idea for weeks. Reliant has opposed anything other than full
payment of its debts.
    ``Williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owed
us,'' spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said. ``We have worked in
very good faith with the state, selling voluntarily into the
market, negotiating with them for long-term contracts and working
with them to solve the problem.''
      Enron Corp., an energy trader that has set aside unspecified
reserve for possible losses in California, has not been approached
about debt forgiveness, said Karen Denne, a company spokeswoman.
      ``This proposal. . . is news to us,'' and does not address
the immediate problem of electricity shortages in California this
summer, Denne said. Industry analysts say California, which has
already had scattered blackouts this winter, will face more this
summer when power demand surges.

                     Buying the Grid

     Davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy PG&E
Corp.'s power transmission system may take another 30 days, though
he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks,
analysts said. He offered few other specifics on the PG&E talks,
said Steve Fetter, group managing director of global power for
Fitch Inc.
     State officials are trying to reach agreement with PG&E and
Edison, as well as with Sempra Energy, to buy their transmission
lines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money at
low interest rates to avoid bankruptcy. A tentative agreement to
buy Edison's lines for $2.76 billion was reached last week. Talks
with Sempra are continuing.
     The governor said he was optimistic an agreement with PG&E
could be reached in two weeks, but negotiations could drag on
longer, Fetter said.
       ``We are making progress,'' Davis said at a news conference
after the analysts meeting at the Cornell Club on the east side of
Manhattan. ``We are close to a final agreement with (Edison) and
relatively close with Sempra.''
      The governor told analysts he's confident he can get a
utility rescue plan that doesn't require an immediate rate
increase, but Davis did say that rate increases are going to be
needed at some unspecified time in the future, Fetter said.
    Davis said he wasn't sure if he resolved all of analysts'
doubts about California's plans to save its utilities from
bankruptcy.
    ``He's in a hole and he's got a long way to go to get out of
it,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston who attended the meeting. ``We still don't have a final
solution in sight.''
     Shares of San Francisco-based PG&E fell 9 cents to $13.96.
Rosemead, California-based Edison shares fell 4 cents to $14.90.
San Diego-based Sempra fell 16 cents to $22.15.

Subject: Producer meeting


The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a ""wet"" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and ""unwaive"" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being ""dry""  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it

		 Subject: Chinese Wall Policy -- final version

Enclosed please find redlined and clean copies of the versions of Executive 
Summary and Policies and Procedure that we plan on posting on LegalOnline.  
The most recent revisions reflect the newly announced Enron Wholesale 
Services organizational structure.  There are still a few unanswered 
questions relating to the EWS structure -- such as whether EWS will be an 
actual entity or simply an unincorporated ""umbrella"" of certain businesses.  
In large part, the revisions are simply more flexible versions of old 
language in light of these unanswered questions.  I would not say that any of 
the revisions amount to substantive changes to the policy.

Please contact me with any comments or questions you may have regarding the 
enclosed; however, please also keep in mind that we are on a very critical 
path towards the scheduled roll-out of LegalOnline.  In that regard, it would 
be greatly appreciated if any requested revisions could be made no later than 
Wednesday, Nov. 29.  Thanks -- Bob

 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    	
   	
    	
   	
 WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced Monday it has filed an administrative action against two   Texasmen for defrauding their former employer, Coastal Corporation.   The CFTC says over a five-month period during 1996, Clay Krhovjak, of Bellville, Texas, and Paul Cochran, of Houston, engaged in a fraudulent trading scheme to allocate profitable trades belonging to Coastal to accounts controlled by other unnamed scheme participants. 	
   	
  The two men were assistant vice presidents at Coastal'scommodity futures trading desk in   Houstonand were responsible for placing energy futures orders for Coastal with floor personnel at the New York Mercantile Exchange, the CFTC said.   The CFTC said the men conducted their scheme through Refined Energy, Inc. of Red Bank, New Jersey, which was one of the NYMEX floor operations used by Coastal.   ""This allocation scheme ensured Cochran, Krhovjakand other participants risk-free personal profits,"" according to the CFTC complaint.   The CFTC also alleges the two men defrauded Coastal by trading ahead of the firm's futures trades, in that they used advance knowledge of Coastal trades to obtain profits illegally for themselves and others.   A public hearing will be held at a later date to determine if the allegations are true and if so, what sanctions are appropriate, the CFTC said.   Separately, in September 2001, Krhovjakand Cochran each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Sentencing in that case is expected in early 2002, the CFTC said.   -By Kim Archer, Dow Jones Newswires;   202-479-0853; <emailaddress>",False

105,2151,"Following are two issues that are currently being debated to which I am 
requesting feedback in order to submit an Enron position prior to the 
Steering Committee being held this week.  

Planning:  Parties are lobbying language to disclose all planning projects 
permitting anyone to join provided the interested party pays the incremental 
cost i.e. TO #1 wants to build a 2000 MW Kv line and maintain rights to all 
2000 MW, TO #2 wants to increase the lines capability by 400 MW and retain 
rights to all 400 MW.  In this scenario, TO #2 would have to pay all costs 
associated with upgrading the line.  The argument is that in an RTO world 
this scenario is irrelevant, however, I see this as a potential seams issue.

ADR:  Parties are lobbying to change language from mandatory binding 
arbitration with limited appeal to FERC TO mandatory binding arbitration only 
if both parties agree with the ability to bypass and go directly to FERC.  
(All entities with the exception of SWRTA currently enforce the former.  
SWRTA additionally has a provision that calls for a pre-arbitration peer 
review.)

FYI:  Class definitions are such that WAPA qualifies for membership in only 
one class and the regions do not fit the affiliate definition.  Therefore, if 
each region wants to join and have one vote per region in said class, they 
must each pay $5000 and the larger entity must pay the net energy to load 
ratio of total load with the larger region collecting pro rata compensation 
from the other regions.

Any comments you have are appreciated.

126,2511,"Hi, Janel,

I thought that I initialed those already.  If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.

In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp.  If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.

Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you.

I'll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group.  She can either assist you or find someone else who can.

Thanks.

Hi Michelle,

I received the two executable copies of the CSA between Enron and KDS Communications.  I'm not sure what the next step is.  Should I overnight these to Ken to sign and then receive them back and sign on this end and he gets one and we get one?  And I'm assuming that no one else in legal has to sign off at this point?  I thought Linda Glynn mentioned something about Richard or someone else providing initials???  

Just let me know.  thanks!

To:	Lay, Kenneth
Subject:	ENRON - A Study in How So Few Could Screw So Many

Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disgusted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrence. 

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nosed, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and held on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometimes daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top executives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlements, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in the Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in February how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the cynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was hopeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e., +/- 20%.  

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afraid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have many working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my savings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your cohorts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending your millions.....

142,3015,"If you guys watched the Monaco Grand Prix this past Sunday...  perhaps you saw the fellow from the Ferrari team who went on the podium to  receive the winner's trophy from Prince Ranier?
 
That was my good friend Luca Baldisserri, who is the chief  engineer for Ferrari and won almost everything these past few years with his  driver Michael Schumacher...Luca is likely the best car engineer in the world,  and is interested to join me in the future as a partner to operate a team in the  U.S. based CART ""IndyCar"" series...
 
I invited you both as our sport requires strong corporate  partners to function... and thought you may have interest with knowledge that  you would be working with some of the best people in the world... which would  make it reasonable to achieve a very positive return on any corporate  investment.
 
Please feel welcome to keep in touch... and to join us  for a race this summer if you wish.
 
Best to you

I am in the process of planning an event that will bring together senior
executives from across the energy industry, to discuss the development of
renewable energy strategies.  The conference will take place in early April
2002 in London.

I am seeking to identify speakers from 	- oil and gas companies
- power generating companies
- governments
- financial and advisory organisations
- technology companies
- associations, institutes and federations

The programme will examine the whole spectrum of renewable energy sources,
with the dynamics and needs of energy companies themselves in mind.  I would
appreciate your thoughts on topics that should be included, potential
speakers/contributors that you could recommend and which sources of
renewable energy you consider to be the most significant.

If you would like to discuss any aspect of the conference please do not
hesitate to contact me, and I very much welcome your suggestions.

Kind regards

Crude Oil Futures Rise as Economy Brightens


    Crude oil futures for April delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.45 to 
$21.74 per barrel yesterday as the government released figures 
showing that the economy grew by 1.4% in the last quarter of 2001. 
The upward revision reinforced Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's 
contention that the recession was ending and supported recent signs 
that fuel demand is picking up steam. In the past month, gasoline 
demand has grown 2.5% from a year ago, averaging 8.4 million bpd, 
helped out by increased sales of SUVs, warmer than usual winter 
temperatures and lower retail prices. Recently, total fuel demand has 
been about 2% below last year, after remaining about 4% below for 
most of the winter due to unseasonably warm temperatures, which 
lowered heating oil demand, and a sharp drop in airline flights after 
September 11th. An agreement between OPEC and other producing nations 
to trim output by almost 2 million bpd appear to be finally taking 
hold. Refiners have also cut runs because of poor profit margins, 
which could add to the total oil in inventories but lowers products 
supply. According to EIA data, oil inventories dropped by 1 million 
barrels, or 0.6%, last week, marking the 2nd consecutive week 
supplies have fallen. Heating oil futures for March delivery rose 
$0.0089 to $0.5628 per gallon in pre-expiry trading. April heating 
oil futures gained $0.017 to $0.5715 per gallon. Gasoline futures for 
March delivery on the NYMEX, which also expired yesterday, lost 
$0.003 to $0.581 per gallon. April gasoline futures climbed $0.0135 
$0.6778 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures on the IPE was 
up $0.48 to $21.33 per barrel.

OPEC Production to Stay Unchanged

    OPEC is will not to adjust production in its March meeting, 
according to its secretary general. OPEC expects oil prices to remain 
at current levels through the first half of this year. The cartel cut 
its production by 1.5 million bpd in January in an effort to bolster 
prices. OPEC may consider adjusting production at its September 
meeting or call an emergency meeting before then if necessary. Prices 
have rallied recently amid rumors of a possible attack on Iraq and 
expectations of a decline in inventories.

    Kinder Morgan shares fell over 11% yesterday, down $5.20 to 
$41.00 per share, and shares of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners dropped

Canadian Producers Receive C$85 Million to Drop Oil Sands Dispute 


    A group of seven Canadian producers will receive C$85 million 
from the Alberta government to end a dispute that threatened to block 
further development of Alberta's massive northern oil sands. The 
agreement with the government and Conoco will settle a complex 
dispute that has dragged on for years. Conoco became involved after 
buying Gulf Canada last year. The companies claimed they were 
deprived of their rights after provincial regulators told them in 
1999 to shutdown about 150 natural gas wells located at Surmont, near 
Fort McMurray. The wells produced natural gas from reservoirs 
overlying the oil sands deposits. The regulators ruled gas production 
would deplete underground pressures, jeopardizing plans by Gulf 
Canada to develop a C$1.3 billion oil sands project. Alberta has 
decided not to pay compensation to the producers which claim C$200 
million annually in lost revenues. Alberta's oil sands, with total 
reserves of 300 billion barrels, are expected to attract at least 
C$25 billion in spending as energy companies proceed with numerous 
projects.

Marathon Holds First Investor Meeting

    At its first investor meeting since its split from US Steel, 
Marathon Oil revealed plans for 2 natural gas projects, a North Sea 
natural gas pipeline and a LNG facility in Mexico. The LNG facility 
would have the capacity to convert 750 MMcf per day of LNG back into 
natural gas to be sold in Mexico and California. Marathon could face 
some stiff competition as there are more than a dozen plans to build 
LNG facilities in or near the US. The project which includes a LNG 
terminal, pipelines and a power plant could start up in 2005. The 
other project is a North Sea pipeline, with a 900 MMcf per day 
capacity, that would run 675 kilometers to a terminal in England. 
Marathon and US Steel traded under a tracking stock structure over 
the last 10 years or so, which restricted the performance of 
Marathons stock. In the past few years, Marathon has been revamping 
its exploration and production business, which was having trouble 
replacing it oil and natural gas reserves. Marathon has cut nearly 
25% of the jobs in its exploration and production unit since 1999 and 
sold most of its Canadian oil assets. It is now focusing on projects 
in Russia, North America, North Africa, Indonesia and the North Sea. 
Marathon was also awarded a stake in one of Saudi Arabia's highly 
valued natural gas projects and has a strong refining and marketing 
partnership with Ashland. In January, Marathon reported a 4th quarter 
loss of $898 million and has about $900 million of debt from the 
breakup with US Steel.

Oil Shares Climb on Rating Upgrade


    Shares of oil companies traded mostly higher yesterday after 
Deutsche Banc Alex Brown upgraded its rating on integrated oil 
companies, citing better prospects for prices ahead. The integrated 
oil group was upgraded to `overweight' from `neutral'. Despite the 
near-term risks to prices and equities, the fundamentals are 
improving, eroding the fear of a price war. As a result, the oil 
price forecast has been increased by $1 to $20.50 per barrel for 
2002. It also upgraded ExxonMobil to `buy' from `market perform' and 
raised its price target on its stock to $46 from $41 to reflect an 
improved outlook for earnings, returns, upstream volume growth and 
the potential for significant multiple expansion during 2002.

BP to End Political Donations 

  
    BP, which operates in over 90 countries, says that as a global 
policy from now on it will make no political contributions from 
corporate funds anywhere in the world. The move comes as US lawmakers 
consider restrictions on corporate donations to politicians and 
political parties. The downfall of Enron has added pressure to revamp 
political campaign finance laws. Enron donated about $6 million to 
politicians since 1989 and had close ties to a range of lawmakers and 
government officials. BP says that it will engage in policy debate, 
stating its views and encouraging the development of ideas, but it 
will not fund any political activity or any political party. BP 
conducts about 40% of its business in the US and is one of the 
largest foreign firms operating in the nation. Most of BP's $840,000 
in US political donations made last year were tied to Amoco and Arco, 
which are now merged with BP. At a federal level, BP's $250,000 of 
donations were split about 60-40 in favor of Republicans, while the 
$590,000 donated at state level was split about 60-40 in favor 
Democrats. In the US, BP has received criticism from environmental 
groups opposed to drilling in protected areas in Alaska. Outside the 
US it has been targeted by human rights groups for its relationships 
with Chinese firms.

Subject: Stephen Bennett


Stephen Bennett, professional meteorologist, was hired into the Research 
group in September of this year as a Specialist based on salary alignment 
criteria.  In retrospect, and upon review, he should have been hired on as a 
Senior Specialist.

After coming on board. it rapidly became apparent that Stephen was clearly an 
""under hire.""  He is well-deserving of an immediate promotion (really more of 
a correction) and pay raise, to be made retroactive at least to the 1st of 
this month. This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring 
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive ""promotion.""

At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron 
designated as ""Professional Meteorologist.""  In fact, the most recent similar 
hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist, 
who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While 
functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job 
classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional 
professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the 
proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This original 
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist 
category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected 
at this time.

Although a ""new-hire"" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work 
experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the 
Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in 
Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations, 
needing no further training and only minimal supervision.

Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enron 
values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed 
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager 
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather 
briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparation 
as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly 
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a 
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through 
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.

Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  He 
designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research 
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather 
derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and 
liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion 
and major upgrade of this web page.

These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen,s regular 
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail, 
to assemble and prepare our trader,s weather report.  Recently, with the 
advent of extended hours for both NYMEX and EnronOnline, Stephen voluntarily 
on his own accord, assists in our new Sunday weather support effort.  As his 
supervisor, fully cognizant of his already standard 50+ hour work week, I do 
not solicit, but readily accept, this above and beyond expectations 
assistance.

In review, the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was 
Enron,s immediate need for a non-standard, fairly unique professional - a 
meteorologist, coupled with Stephen,s desire to work for our company in spite 
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional 
title reflecting his chosen career path..  Once hired, Stephen has clearly 
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well-deserving 
of this immediate and retroactive promotion.",False

Letter from the Editor:

>From time to time, one of these newsletters elicits enough e-mail responses
that it appears a few folks actually read them.

That's really gratifying.

But humbling, too, since some of those responses tend to indicate that we
who work with this site every day may be assuming that our customers are
more familiar with where we put things than actually is the case.

We mentioned last week that we can create special Web sections for ongoing
stories and keep special sections from the newspaper around on the Web site
for a long time after the paper itself may have been misplaced.

Several folks asked where to find these items on the Web site; so we may
not have them as obviously available as we thought.

There is in the left-side navigation bar on all of the News sections of the
site (including the home page) a navigation segment that includes a variety
of special resources including breaking news from the Associated Press,
streaming audio news reports, strange and bizarre news stories -- and a
section labeled ""News Specials.""

It's that ""News Specials"" section where we keep all of the various special
sections we make available on the Web site. You can short cut directly to
it at <urladdress> or you can just use
the navigation link to open it up.

The major ongoing special sections right now involve Enron developments,
the Andrea Pia Yates trial and the country's continuing responses to the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. The page also includes stories still coming
from the June flooding brought on by Tropical Storm Allison.

Special sections from the various areas of the newspaper -- news, features,
sports -- are maintained online in this area as long as they remain of
interest. While some stories from this part of the site -- perhaps the war
in Kosovo -- begin to fade after a time and drop off the Special Reports
page, others -- like the dragging death of James Byrd Jr. -- likely will
remain for years to come.

We even include some special ""Webumentary"" pieces that we have created for
the Web site in cooperation with the staff of the newspaper. These are
articles where we get to work with the writers and photographers as the
story is being developed so that we can add interactive multimedia coverage
to extend the story beyond the limits available in print. A couple of
examples from the current Special Reports area would be pieces called
""Where Ghosts Dwell"" and ""So you wanna be a rock & roll star?"" 

As new stories come along, they will be added. Next up likely will be the
2002 Winter Olympics from Salt Lake City, taking a spot on the page
alongside the coverage already there of the 2000 Summer Games in Australia.

Not all ongoing stories will end up in this section. Some will show up on
the Web site only while they are going on and then will fade away, but the
Special Reports page is a good place to check for stories that you think
might qualify for special extended coverage.

Thanks for visiting, and please let us be your first source for
information.

**Political Recommendations

It does seem that the election process never ends any more. 

Only a few weeks ago, we were going to the polls to cast votes in the
run-off contests to finish settling the 2001 campaigns.

But here we are again in the thick of political posturing as candidates
line up for the 2002 primary contests to decide candidates for this year's
November elections for officials all the way to the U.S. Senate. 

As always, the Chronicle's Editorial Board meets with all of the candidates
trying to get a handle on which are the best of the lot and then shares
this experience with you in the form of recommendations in the various
races. 

This is not a Voters Guide, which we also will provide closer to the
election and which will provide more complete information on all of the
candidates. More like the arts and movie critics of the paper offering
their opinions in the form of reviews, the newspaper's political
recommendations need to be coupled with your own views as you form your own
opinions.  

But whether you consider these recommendations as wise suggestions or an
indication of who you definitely don't want to vote for, we offer them for
your consideration from time to time on the Editorial page of the paper.
And assembled into a complete collection available from either the
Editorial or Politics pages on the Web site.

Check the candidates out at:

*What's New at <urladdress>

**ThisWeek

In addition to covering major news events throughout the metropolitan
Houston area every day, the Chronicle produces 17 different neighborhood
community sections that are included in the paper each week.

Well, actually, each of the ThisWeek publications normally fills a couple
of broadsheet sections to be included in the paper each Thursday.

The community publications are produced by a division of the news
department and include lots of neighborhood news that might not be of
widespread interest to other neighborhoods but can be of great interest to
the local community. 

We here on the Web site don't want you to miss this more personal version
of the news either; so we post articles from all 17 ThisWeek publications
on the site each Thursday, and maintain the pages throughout the week until
the next pulication date rolls around. 

On the home page, you'll find a link for ""ThisWeek"" in that same left-side
navigation segment with the News Specials and the AP breaking news links.  

It's a little redundant, but we thought it might be helpful; so we included
links to the ""ThisWeek"" section of the site in the navigation bar for folks
opening the links to Community resources and the Metro & State news section
as well.

**Archives Access for Non-Subscribers

For a couple of year now, the online archives of the Houston Chronicle and
the Houston Post have been open to Houston Chronicle subscribers. Those of
the Post are offline for some review right now. And <urladdress>
has partnered with Qpass to provide an easy and safe way for
non-subscribers to purchase access to archival material online.

Three kinds of passes allow non-subscribers to search the archives. One is
for 30 days, another for seven days, and a third lasts for 24 hours.  To
buy a pass and start a search, simply go to

<urladdress>

That site also includes answers to any questions you might have about
this new service.

Please note that the Houston Chronicle archives includes only text of
news articles appearing in the Chronicle starting in 1985. It does not
include photographs, classified ads or paid death notices. As part of the
SubscribersADVANTAGE program, the archives remain free to Houston Chronicle
subscribers.

Attached is a fairly distilled summary of the projects Enron's offered to the 
utilities, DWR and the ISO over the past 9-12 months, or so.  With respect to 
the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and 
Edison are included---the desk doesn't keep records of offers rejected, only 
offers accepted.  However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get 
more info on the other power deals offered to Edison, PG&E and SDG&E if folks 
would like that information.  Just let me know. Prices are included for the

Subject:	RE: Benefits Costs

You know, I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right now.   Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing projects I will call them directly.    

Before I can do anything, I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels. I do know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this company.  Until I know what the company number is we won't know which ETS group it was consolidated within.  Probably the Services Group, but maybe Corp.  Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp. accounting can look into the actual intercompany allocations if any.  Tracy, can you do me a favor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and I'll try to give you a call later this week.   (Tracy, I may be able to locate the 2000 and possibly the 2001 allocation sheets but I am  not comfortable that we will still have the budget information for 1998 and 1999.  In addition, the true-ups definately do not go to this level.)

Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited financials for EGP Fuels Company.  Included with these financials are footnote 
	disclosures.  Please provide the following information to be included with these financials.

	1)  Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (I would think that the books of EGP should show the actual charges.  Our reserve records only provide a total distribution allocation.  This will have to come from accounting.)

	2)  EGP Fuels' Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (As stated, this is not prepared at the EGP level.  The best we can do here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this will likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not have available. I'll need to speak with AA&CO directly to determine best course of action.)

	3)  EGP Fuels' Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) for benefit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 1998,
	     1999, and 2000.  (Same as above.)

	Cynthia,

	Please note that Sandy and I did talk but I was left with the expectation that I would still receive some type of response, even if that response was merely that 
	the information is not available.   Also, it was suggested that I try contacting You, Mikie and Sandy for this information but I did not receive a response from 
	any of you without additional proding.  And, those responses left me believing that I would hear more from you, which I did not.  Lastly, I did mention that if
	necessary we could look at using Financial Accounting for this information but this is not desirable since this method will result in fragmented and less 
	accurate information.  Also, Arthur Andersen has indicated that this is not the preferred method of providing this information.  

	Based on the email which follows below I will assume that Financial Accounting is my only recourse and that You will assist in convincing Arthur Andersen
	that this is the only alternative available to meet their timing requirements.

Sandy told me she talked with you last week in the elevator lobby.  Just so you know I am not ignoring you I have literally worked 4 weeks straight without a day off and with an average of 14 hour days!  

I can not do this until my budgets and medical pricing are complete.  If you need it immediately, then you will need to do what Sandy talked with you about last week and that is to get with Financial Accounting.  There is no way I can look at this until later this week.

	Arthur Andersen has requested benefits information necessary to complete audited financials that are required to complete Project Timber (the sale
	of the MTBE assets to EOTT).  The following requests have not been acknowledged and remain unanswered.  Please let me know who I should contact

162,1580,"Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <urladdress>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.",False

Votenet Announces Online Voter Registration Software in Spanish

Washington, D.C. - In support of today's White House celebration of the National Hispanic Heritage Month, Votenet Solutions, Inc. is pleased to announce the Spanish language version of its pioneering Votenet Voter Registration software. The Spanish speaking population in the United States increased by an unprecedented 13 million or 62 % from 22 million in 1990 to 35 million in 2000! The political ramifications of this demographic change are expected to be far reaching. The first step in becoming an involved and informed citizen is registering to vote.  Votenet's Registro De Votacion will provide Hispanic Americans a streamlined and simplified approach to the voter registration process. 
Associations and advocacy groups can add the online voter registration software to their web sites for as little as $995.00 per year.  The features in Spanish include: 
Register to vote  
Report a name change to the voter registration office 
Report a change of address to the voter registration office 
Register with a political party 

Votenet's Voter Registration software will have a dramatic impact in areas with large Hispanic populations including: Florida, Texas, New York, and California.  All of these areas were critical in the 2000 election cycle.  ""With only 50% of Americans voting at the national level, this software enhancement has the ability to raise that number significantly,"" stated Mitch Reisberg, Vice President of Votenet's Sales. 
""We are very excited about adding the Voter Registration in Spanish capability to the Votenet suite of public policy solutions. We believe this product enhancement will add a unique dynamic to voter activism.  All American citizens should exercise their right to vote and Votenet Voter Registration facilitates the first step; registering to vote.  This Spanish language version recognizes the reality that the Hispanic population is the fastest growing segment in the United States,"" said Glen Hughlette, President and CEO of Votenet Solutions. 
The online Voter Registration product, in English and/or Spanish, is available from Votenet Solutions.  Interested groups can learn how to license the software by visiting either <urladdress>  or calling 1-800-VOTENET.",False

199,3566,"OCC has called me and I am on the call and the operations folks seem irritated with my explanation that I no longer cover communications so I have jotted down the notes on the call and would like to hand over to you as appropriate.

Summary notes from Tom Mertz
-There was an oil spill on the Block 49 platform off the coast of LA in Elod (sp?) Bay on an EOTT facility.  
- Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications.
- The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.  But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore.
- Going to do fly over.
- Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard. Coast Guard will meet us at site. 
- We have deployed US environmental to do containment and cleanup
-There is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore.",False

(i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought 
they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the 
commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual

Mark, as discussed here is a draft of my proposed e-mail for your review.  
Please let me know if it accurately reflects our understanding and I will 
then send it out to everyone.  I really think that having Tana come up for a 
few days as soon as she can would be very helpful for Linda and Sharon.

Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process

Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.

In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark 
Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.

With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.

Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.

If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.

Thanks

Here is a document Enron has prepared that describes what we want to see in a wholesale electric Standards Setting Organization (SSO).

I hope you will be able to consider these points for the letter you will be drafting from EPSA to the NERC Board of Trustees.

217,3422,"Ken,  I just wanted to say thanks for all that you and Enron have done for me.  I know you trusted people close to you and they let you down for that Im sorry.  I have always believed in you and what you stand for.  I  know it took tremendous courage to do what you have done over the last couple of weeks.  Whether the people at Enron like it or not I believe you put us first.  I trust that your decision was the right thing given the circumstances. Yes, Im deeply hurt by the last month but the true spirit of Enron will last within me forever.   I started at this company a mid level IT Administrator and I am now a seasoned Director level technologist and leader.  I have had 4 promotions in the last 5 1/2 years.  I have been challenged by this environment.  I believe that I can go anywhere and be successful because of meeting those challenges.  No where else could have provided me these opportunities. In return Im going to stay committed and have faith that due to that committment the Enron spirit will live on.  With all the bad I wanted to remind you of the good. My years of employment with Enron have been the best of my career.  No matter what happens I know I will be fine. I truly wish you and your family the best.  

Take Care

233,2087,"The question is legitimate.  With the potential for exchanges among 
affiliates being very real, the only possible solution is to either prohibit 
affiliate participation or make iron-clad the confidentiality/non-disclosure 
agreement.  Of course, once you allow the affiliate to participate, being 
able to determine if an ""inappropriate"" transfer of information has occurred 
is almost impossible.  The other problem is that Enron has been an advocate 
of affiliate participation in the sale of assets, as long as the relationship 
was arms-length and no preferential treatment was provided.  As proposed, 
PG&E states that its affiliate will be treated the same as other bidders.  
So, I think that leaves us with buttressing the proposed confidentiality 
language to prevent such exchanges as much as possible.

We would also have to assume, for the information to be beneficial to PG&E's 
affiliate, that it would result in PG&E Gen obtaining the assets.  As 
proposed by PG&E, they would have to be the highest bidder, taking into 
consideration certain tax benefits associated with the sale to an affiliate 
(PG&E's proposal, not my assessment).  In other words, PG&E claims that the 
ultimate determination of the winning bidder is price.  If the result was 
that PG&E Gen paid more for these assets than anyone else, it becomes a 
little more difficult to claim that the auction was unfair.  

However, I believe that the ultimate determination is price, with a caveat.  
The caveat is acceptance by PG&E of amendments to the attached service 
agreements.  PG&E allows for bidders to submit amendments to the service 
agreements, but PG&E retains the right to reject the amendments if not 
acceptable to them.  PG&E Gen may know what amendments are and are not 
acceptable.  That may be the inside track for the affiliate.  But again, I 
think it brings us back to ensuring equitable treatment as much as possible 
in the auction protocol rather than preventing PG&E Gen from participating.

If you feel this is not adequate, please let me know.

Mona,
Jeff pointed me to you.  Below are some concerns I have on the PG&E hydro 
auction.  What are your thoughts on the opportunity for PG&E Gen to adversely 
affect the auction outcome through access to non-public information?  Also, 
how strong are the mitigants against this behavior?

Jeff,
Who is handling the PG&E hydro auction?  

I have a concern about PG&E Generation's participation in this auction.  
Every press release from PG&E on this topic goes out of its way to state that 
PG&E Gen will be a bidder.  My concern is their access to non-public 
information and how this may skew the results of the auction.  If you're the 
person on this, let's talk.  If not, pls let me know who is.  Hope you're 
doing well.

238,1387,"The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.  

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

 If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.

Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively ""a cost of capital"" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

In addition to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.

Please remove these amounts from the ENA-HPL 2002 Plan.

As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.

NEVP called at 21:00 and informed us the cut.  Dynegy was not able to resupply the energy so I bought APS tranny and power from EPE for $70.00 and will show it in the EL PASO model as a sell from EPE to DYNEGY 8MW @ $70 Palo Verde.  The Tranny from APS was $3.50, and I will show an annuity for this amount billed to Dynegy.  I built two annuities for the tranny purchase from APS and its subsequent billing to Dynegy (674830 & 674831).  The EPEC deals that relate to the cut are 674832 and 674833.

Please call me with any questions.

?

I was intrigued by your interview in the 10/30/00 issue of InternetWeek 
Onlineas we seem to share the desire to transform the system.? Despite Enron,
s better business model, robust software infrastructure is as critical to 
Enron,s success as for any other Fortune 1000 company.? Should you agree with 
our mission to deliver that infrastructure, we would be most honored to have 
you join our Advisory Board (includes stock option compensation).

?

SEADE Software is developing a new category of software we call an 
Application Deployment Engine (ADE).? I stress that this is a new category of 
software.? The ADE shares some of the features of several existing 
categories), but no existing product, or combination of products, has 
thepotential of having such a profound, disruptive affect on the process of 
developing complex, enterprise-scale eBusiness software.? The ADE enables 
rapid deployment of feature-rich, secure, scaleable, open-platform, 
best-of-breed eBusiness software in &Internet Time8.? In addition, it 
provides for better and more cost effective life cycle management and 
integration of that software.? Note that the SEADE team has previously built 
the ADE three times as the framework for specific vertical applications.? 

?

While this is a new category of commercial software, it,s not a particularly 
new idea.? What we are doing has in fact always been the way the academic 
world has said complex software systems should be written.? The evolution 
from structured languages, to object orientation has been a continual effort 
to find a means to leverage the effort and resources used to deploy past 
applications for the deployment of the next application.? Most enterprise 
software shares between 60-90% of its core foundation and features with all 
other software.? We call these common horizontal components the &Common 
Horizontal Framework8,of a custom application.? The vertical components are 
the parts that make the software valuable enough to risk the resources to 
develop and deploy mission critical applications. 

?

SEADE Software,s core competency is the delivery of the horizontal components 
that make up the majority of all business applications.? We deliver this in a 
highly customizable, component-based, platform-independent, fully 
internationalized, pre-fabricated software application we call an ADE.? The 
ADE enables fast-tracked development of new integrated eBusiness applications 
and provides a common reference for legacy Enterprise application integration 
(many-to-many EAI).? We empower the Fortune 1000 to maximize their core 
competency by leveraging ours.

?

I,ve attached for your review our Executive Summary, Business Case Slideshow 
pitch, and Advisory Board bios.? Please let me know if you find our offer of 
interest.? Thank you for your consideration.

Scott

Kori, Errol --

After speaking with Enpower IT, I was informed there were 2 calcs performed for Lavo's power books yesterday.

14370 - 4:11 PM (officialized)
14378 - 4:17 PM (not officialized)

14370 didn't have the positions, therefore, nothing is being picked up in RiskTrac. 14378 had the positions, but it was not saved as officialized, so RiskTrac is not picking it up as well.

We need to have 14378 saved as official so RiskTrac can pick up the positions.
Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks.

A few notes.

1.	Be cautious about divestiture.  Remember we own pipes and a electric LDC.

2.	Agree with you that we don't want Utility in merchant role - key issue.

3.	POLR issue involves getting pricing right.

Why don't you put together a note to the CAEM that we can send as our thoughts.  Just the Top 5 issues.

Attached are summarized the main recommendations of the distco of the future paper and  their impact.
Most recommendations would have a positive impact on competition. However, some recommendations could be potentially dangerous. Besides, it does not have a clear position regarding unbundling: it opens too many unbundling possibilities and discards the extreme, and more effective (divestiture).
I will work on the default supplier paper today.

?	On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
?	The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
?	Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
?	The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
?	In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own ""date certain"" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
?	The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
?	We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
?	We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

294,2924,"Rick, Jim and Jeff:  Here's a draft of the e-mail I intend to send to Sandy 
and Mike re: use of Mike Day in Sacramento.  Let me know your thoughts.  




It appears from talking with both of you that we have some confusion on how 
we will contract for legal services to support or legislative efforts.  
Hopefully this e-mail will clarify the process so there is no confusion in 
the future and so that Mike can feel comfortable he is completing work that 
is authorized and for which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears that Goodin, MacBride has billings as of May 11 for 
approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall profits, the ""Global 
Settlement,"" Power Plant Siting.  We will cover these amounts because of the 
apparent confusion with our budgeting and approval process.  The amounts 
already incurred should be included in the RCRs discussed below.  

2.  As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May 
was conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know 
we terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs 
were filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis; the 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, a proposed budget is not RCR approval.  

3.  In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arises--i.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, then I should be 
contacted before completing any work.  If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes 
should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, then Rick Shapiro should be 
contacted.   In this regard, I authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in 
the Direct Access coalition meetings taking place today and tomorrow.  I also 
authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  To the maximum extent possible, I expect that Mike will 
include Leslie Lawner in future Direct Access meetings, legislative drafting 
efforts, etc.  

4.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, I should be contacted before undertaking an assignment.  
If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, 
then Rick Shapiro should be contacted.  I can be reached through my office 
line--503.464.7945, pager--888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  I wear 
the pager at all times and respond immediately to messages left on the 
pager.  

5.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride; it simply means that before that work begins 
Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and ""Plan B,"" to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  I 
recognize that Sacramento is a difficult environment and that there is 
substantial pressure on both of you.  However, we are under an obligation to 
use our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process is designed to meet that responsiblity.",False

322,805,"Mike,
As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art
Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I
would like to accomplish the following:

1) Discuss our Vision for the collection
2) Introduce Ned and Barry
3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings
4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable
5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the
decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision
and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The
latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but we
definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.
Questions right now for you:
1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?
2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should
we postpone?  Barry is a ""maybe"".  Remember they are there to help us shape
a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any
purchasing ""mistakes"".
3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss it?
Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list
of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so
that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud
and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.
Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are
considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to
discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed a
call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to
meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like
to propose a ""water piece"" for the circular drive.  You will recall that
Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very
well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow ""up"" and
wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked
his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in
Houston on their next trip.
Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging
in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Here is the spreadsheet I received from PSEG regarding the price issue with deal 759607.  It looks like our price does not include the fuel percentage for any month or the change in GPS beginning with August.  I have highlighted these rows on the spreadsheet.  From their spreadsheet, we have under billed by $350K.  Please review and let me know what you think.  I also have a copy of the confirm from PSEG if you need it.

Hello to the Direct Access Coalition:

Below you will find a summary of the press strategy that Edelman Public
Relations intends to employ over the coming weeks in collaboration with the
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and the broader Direct Access Coalition.
I will also outline the information that I need from Direct Access Coalition
members who are willing to be involved in media outreach and interviews.
And finally, I have attached supporting documents that you can use as
background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that
you may receive.

This Week

1.   We are drafting a ""pitch letter"" to send out by the end of this week
via blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corps
reporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)
trade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Our
pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&I
customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are
suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will
address the effect on California's future business climate if direct access
is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x
caused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no
matter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a
part of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate
California businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a
prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.

2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access
Coalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press
strategy outlined here.

3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to
take media calls on behalf of the coalition.

Next Week

1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.

2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an
opportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.
Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be
effective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sending
a media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after
the hearing.

3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.

4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California
Capitol Week and the California Report) to secure
media interviews.

5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of
the amended language in SB 27x.

 What We Need From You

1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have
customers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please
respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact
information.

2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers
on behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to
do this for the you.

3.  If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with the
media it would be helpful to have this information so that we can
collaborate as necessary.

>  All documents are works in progress, so if you have suggestions on
> potential changes, please feel free to share them with us.

Sara is out of the office for the rest of the week, but I understand why you guys have trouble with me specifically being listed.  Instead of my number being put in there, can we just use the general Enron Corp phone number (1-800-973-6766) and have UBS ask to be connected to the Treasurer's office.  There will always be a person there to take the call, and you will always be directed to the right person regardless of what employee reassignments may occur between now and then.

Jim, what do you think of this?  Christine, since Sara is out, would you please include Jim Armogida on the distribution list.  Thanks.

Subject: Equity Forward Contract


Sara,

Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations 
so promptly.    We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page 8 of 
the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented. 
 Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any 
reason (either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail), the 
termination notice would not be effective.

We propose to insert the following language instead:


	""Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable efforts 
to 
     promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice by 
     telephone (telephone number 713-345-7538) to the Affected Party, 
     provided however, that failure to so confirm will not in anyway 
     invalidate the effectiveness of a notice by facsimile 
transmission.""
     
     (insert as the last sentence of the third paragraph under 
""Additional 
     Termination Event"".)

Please let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will produce new 
contracts with the language and send it back to you for another round 
of signatures.

Please call me if you have any questions.  I apologize for any 
inconvenience this may cause.

Regards,
Christine

John has asked that you place your people only in the desks allotted to you.  Assistants should be colored in white where applicable.  Some teams are still in the same area and changes may not be necessary.  

If all of your commercial organization does not fit, please send me back a list of those people who will need to be assigned a desk on the fifth floor. 

John would like to have a final revision of this by end of day tomorrow (Thursday). 

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention, 
Tammy

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Shelley Norman",False

I received the following information from Oneok concerning the missing Mt. Jesus payments.  Lisa Voth, the condensate accountant for Oneok, stated she need the volume statements from Debbie Mosely reflecting the Mt.Jesus volumes and production periods.  Dan, do you have access to Debbie's spreadsheet statements?  If I can be of any assistance, please let me know.
Lynn, I left a message with Sherry Rodgers requesting all stranger gas statements dating back six months.

Subject:	RE:  Mt. Jesus payment


Each month I receive run statements from third party vendors showing volumes
of condensate purchased during the month, I also receive field tickets to
match up to the statements.  In regards to the Mt. Jesus location, we do not
receive such documentation.  We have no way to distinguish if any volumes
were purchased from Mt. Jesus since we do not receive statements, nor
tickets.  Our trader, Jon Hanna received a spreadsheet showing volumes NNG
believes we owe for the Mt. Jesus location.  Can you send me the
documentation NNG is using to come up with these volumes.

Thank you,

One of the most important ingredients of fiction is its characters. Think
of any memorable book, play or movie and you'll recall its people--from
protagonist (and deuteragonist and tritagonist and ...) to antagonist are
folks one can feel, relate to, though not necessarily always agree with.
These are the people with depths, they are not cardboard characters or
people who live a 2D life, to use the publishing jargon. These multifaceted
people come alive on the pages of a book, on the stage of a theater, or on
the screen of a movie theater with all their foibles, follies and victories.
Perhaps the ultimate sign of their character is that they live on on the
pages of dictionaries. This week's AWAD focuses on a few of these fictional
persons who came alive and added a bit more color to our language.     -Anu

What's It Worth To You?

Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.
- Oscar Wilde

Certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products - products that avoid the acid rain, smog, global warming, and soot pollution caused by mainly coal-burning power plants. Perhaps with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year, the Duquesne Light service territory will be the first market where both price and value of renewable energy are understood and motivate large numbers of customers to buy (see case studies that follow).

Moreover, a new study published in the August 24, 2001 edition of Science, by Mark Z. Jacobson and Gilbert M. Masters of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, shows that the ""cost gap"" between coal power and the cheapest forms of renewable energy is narrowing sharply, down to about 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Most importantly, professors Jacobson and Masters document that the apparently slightly lower cost of coal generation is more illusion than reality, due to its real costs.

When coal generation's environmental and health costs like damage to air, water and forests, as well as human illness and death, are included in the calculation, coal generation's real price jumps to about 5.5 cents to 8.3 cents per kWh. By comparison, the 4.0 cents to 5.0 cents cost of wind energy makes it a bargain. 

""Wind energy is unequivocally less expensive than is coal energy,"" say Jacobson and Masters.

How Much Is That Kilowatt-Hour?
It's not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still don't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage. 

Yet lack of knowledge goes beyond value in electricity markets. Consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything. 

Even sophisticated observers don't know the price of comparative products, regardless of the added environmental and public health costs. Price transparency is a bad joke, because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in Houston.

In those states that allow customers to choose a generation supplier, few consumers and policymakers know what their local utility charged for generation prior to competition, including what are now called stranded costs. Perhaps even fewer know how prices alone, not including the stranded cost charges, of today's competitive products compare to their utilities' unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition. Or how today's renewable energy prices compare to utilities' pre-competition generation rates. 

And how many know how today's price to compare or default rate compares to the pre-competition, monopoly generation rate (which includes stranded costs)? Confusion on these basic questions is widespread and distorts perception and policy. 

It is vital for policymakers to know the answers in order to formulate wise policy (see for answers, ""It's All in the Numbers,"" E3, Vol. 3 No. 12). But even that's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity: ""What is it worth?"" 

An important change that will affect the answer is on the horizon. Beginning in February, 2002, stranded cost charges will be eliminated from electric bills in the Pittsburgh area. These are payments made to Duquesne, primarily to cover its prior investments in uneconomic, nuclear generation, recovered from consumers through the Competitive Transition Charge (CTC).

The following examples of typical types of customer bills in the Duquesne Light territory illustrate comparative prices at pre-restructuring or present default rates, the new default rates that will take effect next year, and for various renewable energy products. 

These examples will hopefully clear away some of the haze surrounding the true price of renewable products.

Residential Customers
A typical residential customer (rate RS) using 600 kWh per month has been paying Duquesne Light about $75 per month since rates were capped in 1996. Of this monthly $75 bill, about $48 is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services.

In turn, more than $20 of the $48 total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges. Since customer choice began, all 600 kWh residential customers - including those choosing a competitive supplier - have had to pay Duquesne the same $20 for stranded costs. If customers were not required to pay Duquesne for its stranded costs, this typical customer's total bill would be less than $55, a whopping 27 percent less than it is now.

As a result of stranded cost charges, customers choosing a competitive supplier can only avoid paying Duquesne about $28 of its $48 generation rate, where the $28 reflects the ""shopping credit"" or price to compare that has been available. So, only if a customer could buy 600 kWh per month for less than $28, including transmission, would s/he save money by switching to a competitive supplier. 

As you can see, stranded cost charges and the weird economics and pricing they produce make it difficult to know the price of electricity, let alone the value of renewable generation. 

If our typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today for 6.0 cents/kWh, the consumer would pay $36 for generation - $12 per month less than the historic regulated generation rate of $48. At a rate of 7.0 cents/kWh, the same consumer would pay $42 for renewable generation, or $6 per month less. The price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents/kWh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power. 

There are presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products in Duquesne's territory (three are Green-e certified), for prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 7.0 cents/kWh. Renewable generation today costs substantially less than coal and nuclear generation did prior to competition. Yet, the $20 stranded cost charge that a 600 kWh renewable energy residential customer must pay in the Duquesne service territory has concealed not just the value of renewable energy, but also its real price. 

Until February, a customer buying renewable generation for 7.0 cents/kWh - or $6 less than the pre-competition rate - will still have a total bill, including CTCs and distribution charges, that is $12 more than their current bill. While many might find that $12 more per month for cleaner energy and its associated benefits is still reasonable, many more who are motivated by their wallets alone probably would not. But a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as CTCs in the Duquesne Light territory are about to be eliminated. 

While the Public Utility Commission still hasn't established what the new regulated rates will be, it appears that a typical 600 kWh per month customer who buys generation from Duquesne/Orion will receive a rate reduction of about 16 percent, saving about $12 per month. However, customers won't receive the full savings from the elimination of CTCs because a portion will cover the costs of Duquesne's integration into the PJM-West Independent System Operator.

But as soon as the stranded cost charges are removed, a typical residential consumer could buy renewable energy products and pay less than what s/he paid for electricity under default rates, and less than s/he paid in 1996. Both the price and value will then be motivating factors for buying renewable energy.

When the CTC is removed, the residential customer using 600 kWh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve one-third of his/her load - for a total of $68, or a savings of $7 compared to today's default rate. Even if the customer were to buy all of his/her electricity from one of the new wind farms being built in southwestern Pennsylvania, the customer would pay less than $3 more per month than s/he is currently paying for default generation.

If the customer chooses a blended product with both renewable and non-renewable content for 6.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill would be $5 less than what it is today. Even at a price of 7.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill for a blended product would be less than $1 per month more, or only about $8 more per year, than the price currently paid for default service of mostly nuclear and dirty coal-generated power.

The end of CTCs in Duquesne's territory will allow a residential customer to switch from traditional, dirty generation to renewable generation and still save money, or pay only pennies more.

Business and Institutional Customers
The dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher, but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets. For example, a small commercial customer on rate GS/M, such as a restaurant or convenience store, using 10,000 kWh per month and with a demand of 23 kW, has been paying $808.52 per month for regulated or default service. 

With elimination of the CTC and the PJM-West integration costs, their bills will likely decrease about 11 percent, for a total monthly bill of about $720, a savings of about $88 per month. A small commercial customer could use the savings to buy enough wind energy to meet 25 percent of its load - saving about $26 per month compared to present bills, and still paying less for electricity than in 1996.

A large commercial/industrial customer on rate GL, such as a large hotel, hospital or a small college or manufacturer, using 1.168 million kWh/month and a demand of 2,000 kW has been paying about $69,440 per month for regulated or default service. With elimination of the CTC, the bill will likely decrease about 8 percent beginning around September, 2002, for a total monthly bill of around $63,900; a savings of about $5,540 per month. 

Those substantial savings could then be invested in purchasing renewable energy without increasing electricity bills above either current or 1996 levels. For example, a hospital could serve 30 percent of its load with a blended product for 5.5 cents/kWh and still save about $1,225 per month compared to its current default bill. Two hospitals could purchase the entire output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to supply over 15 percent of their total electricity requirements and still save about $5,200 per month compared to their present bills. Even if a single hospital purchased the output of an entire wind turbine, enough to serve 31.4 percent of its load, the total additional cost of $3,209 per month would be only about $3,840 more per year than their current default bill.

For hospitals, which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coal-generated power every day, how much is that worth?

Municipal consumers on rate SM for street lighting, using 110,000 kWh per month, have been paying $33,130 per month for regulated and default electricity. With elimination of the CTC, the bill would decrease to $27,220, but with the PJM-West transition costs the bill may decrease about 14.5 percent, for a total monthly bill of $28,320; a savings of about $4,810 per month.  About three municipal customers with that consumption level could join together to purchase the output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to meet their entire electricity load and still save about $2,850 per month each, compared to their current default costs. A single municipal customer could still save about $880 per month compared to their current bill if they purchased a blended product at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

What *is* it worth?
What will renewable energy be worth to Pittsburgh's families, businesses, institutions and governments? Buying renewable is the single best thing any consumer can do to protect our environment and public health. Its value is great and its price in Pittsburgh will become less distorted with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year. The savings of $20 per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial, industrial, and municipal accounts, gives Pittsburgh a great opportunity to become America's first green-powered city. The price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in 1996 or even what many are paying now. 

The value of that opportunity is priceless.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Beth Quigley",False

I talked with Peggy this morning. We want to get all the facts and

467,2685,"As evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter, 
Enron,s wholesale energy businesses in North America and Europe continue to 
experience tremendous growth.  The opportunities to continue to grow our 
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to 
Enron,s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses 
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.

It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of 
gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnings 
growth.  We have made significant progress in developing these businesses in 
North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net Works business unit.  
Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products, 
coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest rates, credit 
trading, paper and pulp, and metals.

While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to 
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to 
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North America 
and Europe.  In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on 
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today 
announcing the formation of a new business unit ) Enron Global Markets.  This 
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in 
scope, but outside our traditional gas and power markets.  This new core 
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with 
the North American and European businesses.

Enron Global Markets will be headed by Mike McConnell, President and Chief 
Executive Officer, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer.  They will 
report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Enron Global Markets.  Mark, 
Mike and Jeff will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Global 
Markets.

Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the 
Chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders:
- Global Crude and Products:     John Nowlan
- Coal:         George McClellan
- Currency, equities, interest rate and agricultural trading:  Gary Hickerson
- Insurance and weather:      Jere Overdyke

Enron,s metals business and Enron <urladdress> will remain the responsibility 
of Enron Europe. The Paper and Pulp business will continue to reside in North 
America. 

With the departure of Mike McConnell from Enron Net Works, we are pleased to 
announce the following appointments in that business unit:
- Jeff McMahon: President and Chief Operating Officer
- Louise Kitchen: Chief Commercial Officer
- Philippe Bibi:  Chief Technology Officer

Jeff, Louise and Philippe, along with Greg Whalley,  will comprise the Office 
of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.

With Jeff Shankman,s departure from Enron North America,s natural gas 
operation, all of Jeff,s direct reports will report to John Lavorato.

We are also pleased to announce the following changes to the Enron North 
America Office of the Chairman.  John Lavorato will join the ENA Office of 
the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Dave Delainey will assume the role 
of President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mark Frevert will retain his role 
as Chairman of Enron North America in addition to his role as Chairman of 
both Enron Global Markets and Enron Europe.

Please join us in congratulating everyone in their new assignments and in 
supporting the new Enron Global Markets organisation.",False

Subject: Questions regarding PSD permit for Lincoln


Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring ("" CEM"") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

It was his only play of the game, which demonstrates how little his Fantasy value is these days.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updat! ed! 10/15/01 The Bears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when Seattle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami on Oct. 28. ""The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy,"" Holmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so far, but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played mistake-free football.  ! Ma! rk Brunell , QB JAC - WidowMakers Updated 10/15/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play in Week Six.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/15/01 Smith sprained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is not considered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/15/01 Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injury on Sunday at Seattle. The Denver Post says Griese's shoulder will be re-examined on Monday or Tuesday. ""I was able to come back and ! pl! ay this week, and I'm hoping to do the same next week,"" Griese said.  Chad Johnson , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Johnson is expected to miss six weeks with a fractured collarbone. He injured the shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might now become Cincinanti's third receiver.   Terry Jackson , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Jackson suffered a calf injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next week's game at Chicago.   Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Fightin Farm! er! s Updated 10/15/01 The Buffalo News says Johnson (neck)  looked good in practice on Sunday. He is expected to play in Week Six. """"He threw the ball extremely well, especially in the wind today,"" said coach Gregg Williams. ""He had a fresh arm. It seems like there is no residual effect from it right now.""   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Terminators Updated 10/15/01 A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishing Sunday's game. He is expected to play in next week's game against the Redskins.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/15/01 Mathis shook off a hip injury and played i! n ! Sunday's game. However, a sprained hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury isn't considered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Christian suffered bruised ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Sack Attack Updated 10/15/01 Jefferson missed a lot of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left big toe. He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Okie Pride Updated 10/15/01 The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. The Rams originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collateral ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage.   Rams coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three weeks.   ""They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to four weeks,"" Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New Orleans Saints on October 28.   ""We'll see,"" Faulk said. ""It's kind of early to say, but you never know.""     Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exchange on Carolina's second posse! ss! ion, losing another fumble when his arm was hit as he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All three turnovers led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished 21-of-39 for 196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserve for now.    Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/14/01 Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters returns.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a reserve at this point.   Lamar Smith ,! R! B MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/14/01 Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/14/01  Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right.   Glyn Milburn , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14/01 Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider droppin! g ! Bennett altogether.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat.   Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Fighti! n ! Farmers Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.  Travis Taylor , WR BAL - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore passing game.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc   FB10NF",False

Speaking of Canadian eligible contract participants...I was told from an 
originator in Canada that per someone in Enron Canada's legal department, 
Canadian contract participants are not held to the same standards as US (i.e. 
they are not required to have minimum assets &/or equity etc.).  Is this 
true???  Please advise and forward to me the eligible contract participant 
information we discussed at the happy-hour last wednesday.

Thanks

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  ""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind,"" he said. ""The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators.""

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a ""blind pig could
make money"" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  ""It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it,"" Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP ""an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers.""

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

495,1180,"Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they 
rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and 
don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the 
columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled 
Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they 
need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to 
keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian ""logic.""

And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an 
email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the 
first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 
million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted 
the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if 
that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her 
at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian 
p&l and for the originations total.  

Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country 
capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT 
stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.

I'll whine more later,

of follow-up items:

Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams, Sen Wyden is very interested in 
identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO (and PX to the 
extent it's still relevant) to make the market work better.  We have written 
this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.  Alan -- 
please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.  I think we should 
identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that 
could be sent to the FERC.
Murkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the 
fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is 
necessary  to address the California crisis.  We have identified the need for 
open access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the 
2-4 month time frame.  Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.  Sue -- 
could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get 
them to Linda?
Finally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to 
""price gouge"" -- yes, that's what she said.  She appealed to everyone's 
community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while 
California struggles to fix its problems.  I think we should send a response 
from Ken.  Jeff -- please take a cut and get to Linda.  I think the basic 
messages should be:  we are actively working on solutions with California 
policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively 
pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.  We should also explain the 
nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we 
identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc.",False

Paul / Dan:

A summary of the alternatives related to the LNG winter cargo follows:

	1. If we don't do anything and Cabot does not deliver: 
		a. We may save $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges, but will have exposure to spot fuel prices at a time when prices are expected to rise.

	2. Write a letter to Cabot notifying them that we have an opportunity to secure a winter cargo now and have them confirm their commitment to a winter cargo delivery. 

		a. Should Cabot commit to a winter cargo we would be in the same position we are today with the exception that they no longer have the ability to cancel the winter cargo on short notice. If we later decline to receive the winter cargo we still pay the $4.7 million in demand charge and surcharge. We would decline to nominate a winter cargo from Cabot only if spot fuel prices are lower than the commodity charge and surcharge.	
					
		b. Should Cabot not commit to a delivery we are relieved of the obligation to pay the $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges and can buy a spot cargo at an additional savings. The total potential benefit to EcoElectrica of the transaction can be close to $5 million at the current LNG prices (this scenario will be better if prices go down)..

Given where the LNG market is today we should proceed to send the letter to Cabot.

Have reviewed the possibility of purchasing a non-Cabot Winter Cargo.  Please review and comment.  The analysis should be looked at in conjunction with the narrative written by Paul included in the attached email.  For detail of analysis, refer to the following Excel icon. 

 


	Items for Consideration and/or Assumptions 	

Cabot's willingness to release the right  not deliver the Winter Cargo (time is of essence in getting Cabot to make this decision in Eco's favor)
Purchase of non-Cabot cargo at 10 cents lower than our 2002 Estimated Commodity Charge and Surcharge Rate. Should consider other scenarios. 	
PRCPI growth of 5.5%, could be updated given the availability of 4-month actual data. 
NYMEX to be continued updating - actual and future. 
Have not considered other incidental expenses related to the transaction.

Ernesto,

Below is a discussion of some of the key contractual issues surrounding the 2002 Winter Cargo. You may also want to review the contract to gain an understanding of how the delivery dates are set for the Last Cargo of 2001, the 2002 Winter Cargo, and the 2002 Early Spring Cargo.

We can discuss this opportunity for Eco in a few days after you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the issues.

Subject:	Eco Winter Cargo

Below are the key points of a conference call held on Friday, May 11, 2001. Attending were Gene Massey of Arent Fox and Coralina Rivera, Dan Masters, and Paul Y'Barbo of Enron. The call was in reference to the LNG supply contract between EcoElectrica and Cabot LNG. Enron LNG got the answers it hoped to get and more.

1. Article 12.3 gives Cabot the right to not deliver a Winter Cargo to Eco if Cabot is unable to complete an Algerian Loading within a window specified in the contract. Cabot could give notice to Eco as late as 3 days prior to the scheduled loading of the Winter Cargo that Cabot will be unable to deliver the cargo. The failure to complete the Algerian Loading must not be the result of a default by Cabot or Distrigas. The failure to achieve an Algerian Loading may not necessarily be the result of an Algerian Force Majeure situation. 

2. Article 12.3 (b) (iv) gives Eco the right to secure replacement fuel for the Winter Cargo. If Eco notices Cabot that Eco has the opportunity to secure replacement fuel, then Cabot has 10 days to notify Eco whether or not they are willing to release the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Eco may buy replacement fuel regardless of whether or not Cabot releases the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. In other words, even if Cabot commits to delivery of a Winter Cargo, Eco is under no obligation to purchase a Winter Cargo from Cabot. 

If Cabot is unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo, then Eco will buy the replacement fuel and will not have to pay the Demand Charge or Demand Surcharge on the Winter Cargo, a quantity equal to 119,000 cubic meters (~$4.7 MM).

If Cabot releases its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo and Eco still buys the replacement fuel, then Eco will receive no reduction in the annual Demand Charges and Demand Surcharge.

Eco has until December 1st to give notice that it has the opportunity to buy replacement fuel. It was Gene's opinion that the sooner Eco gives notice (today would be good), the less likely Cabot would be willing to give up its right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Thus, the more likely Eco would be able to get a reduction in Demand Charges and elimination of the Demand Surcharge.

Important Note: The economics of the deal work such that the largest monetary benefit of buying replacement fuel exists when December/January/February U.S. natural gas prices are at their lowest point of the year.

If U.S. natural gas prices were to go down a little further, Eco would want to buy more non-Cabot LNG than just the Winter Cargo replacement.

3. Per Article 7.5, Eco's annual purchase commitment is 66% of the LNG consumed at the Power Facility up to a maximum of 19.46 TBtu (~7 Standard Cargoes). In a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco would need to ""purchase"" 6 Standard Cargoes from Cabot. Failure to do so would result in payment of liquidated damages of approximately $0.36/MMBtu.

Important Note: Per Article 7.5, if replacement fuel is purchased rather than buying a Winter Cargo from Cabot, that quantity counts as though it were purchased from Cabot for the purpose of assessing whether or not Eco met its annual purchase commitment. Thus, in a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco could buy replacement fuel instead of a Cabot Winter Cargo plus 5 Standard Cargoes from Cabot and still meet its annual commitment.

There are benefits to Eco for buying replacement fuel - certainty of supply and a lower price. Enron LNG should continue to pursue a deal with Eco. I plan to schedule a meeting with Mariella Mahan as soon as she is available.

I will provide an update of the economics of this trade in my next e-mail.

Subject: Order Instituting Rulemaking to Establish Policies and Cost
Recovery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement


On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a
rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to
resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related
hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also
address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The
ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week
so
that I can send in the required letter.

542,3175,"Enron Global Markets ended the year with a great deal of momentum and with 
very high expectations for 2001.  In order to better focus and expand the 
various businesses within Global Markets, we are pleased to announce the 
following organizational changes.

Crude and Products
This group is being re-organized into product lines in order to better focus 
and maximize coverage and increase our market-making abilities.  The 
following individuals leading these groups report directly to John Nowlan.

Global Crude Oil
Don Schroeder and Bill White will manage our global crude oil books.  Don,s 
emphasis will be on the development and expansion of our physical crude 
positions both domestically and abroad.  Bill will manage the various 
financial crude positions globally and will focus on developing these books.

Distillate
Chris Mahoney will have responsibility of all distillate positions.  Chris 
will focus on developing our global distillate strategy, building the 
business both physically and financially.

Global Fuel Oil
Niamh Clarke will expand her role managing our global fuel oil and resid 
positions.  Emphasis will be placed on re-establishing Enron in the financial 
fuel market in the US and developing a physical fuel strategy.

Global Gasoline and Components
Jim Goughary will assume responsibility for our global gasoline and 
components business.  Following up on our expansion into the European market 
in 2000, we look forward to Jim expanding our presence in the US as well as 
Asian Markets.

Global LPG
Erik Hansen and Adam Gross will be responsible for the development and 
execution of our global LPG trading and strategy.  Under their guidance we 
look to expand our presence into the Asian Pacific markets, as well as 
continuing to grow our US and European operations.

Petrochemical and Plastics
Stuart Bland and Douglas Friedman will be responsible for the continued 
development and growth of our petrochemical and plastics business.  They will 
work to further expand both our physical and financial presence in these 
markets.

Fuel Management
Doug Leach will continue in his role developing our fuel management business 
as well as other long-term structural transactions. 

Global Origination
Randy Maffett has joined the group to lead, develop and grow all global 
origination activities for the group.  Randy,s most recent assignment was in 
restructuring several equity investments for ENA.  

Enron Freight
This new group under the leadership of Dan Reck is developing a business in 
the inter-modal transportation area in the United States.  Shawn Cumberland 
has joined this group to lead and expand the origination opportunities in 
this business.  Shawn,s most recent assignment was as COO of the CALME region.

Global Risk Management
Jere Overdyke has elected to leave Enron after almost 10 years of service.  
Per Sekse will take over the leadership of this very exciting and growing 
business.  Per is located in Enron,s New York office but will be spending a 
significant amount of his time in Houston.

We look forward to this year and feel the above changes will provide the 
focus and momentum we need to deliver a record performance in 2001.

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignments.",False

Hi Stephanie,

Thank you very much for the update (scary as it sometimes sounds). I know you're swamped but if we could review and talk about a synopsis of the gas options on Friday it would be very helpful. I think that we should be prepared to talk to Chris and Jake early next week as it looks like a pretty high probability (assuming we can't get there with Puget, Mirant or Engage) that we may need to step up to the Expansion. 

Let us know what your schedule looks end of this week and early next. Thanks very much! 

Regards,
Laura

Spoke with Kern today - They are evaluating the economics of two expansion projects: Rockies to Stanfield (piggyback of displacement fix) and across the Gorge (Stanfield to I-5).  NWPL's least cost expansion of the Gorge is for roughly 55,000 mmbtu/day. At the present time, they plan to offer the cheap expansability to their existing shippers on June 20 as Phase II of the displacement fix. Existing customers will have 30 days to decide.

While NWPL remains undecided about the timing of an expansion out of the Rockies, the project has not yet disconnected from the displacement fix. Current best guess on economics (this is a moving target) for Rockies expansion is in the low $.50's plus $.40's for Gorge (and this excludes fuel).

Another option would be to use existing PGT capacity (or participate in their 6/19 binding open season) to Stanfield and participate only in the Gorge project.  If we were ready, we could force Kern into a Gorge expansion prior to June 20. To drive the process, we would need to be the anchor tennant and be subject to the outcome of an open season that could result in upward pressure on the rate.

I have asked Eric Moon to help analyze and map all of the options. Hope to have something to send to you on Friday.

MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS
Patient but Not Passive
A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswomen. She is strong and resolute, but not in a hurry. 
Patricia Sellers
Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2001



For some 30 years--ever since women started jockeying for power in the workplace--patience has gotten a bad rap. After all, the virtue fairly reeks of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive wife and mother. So women have shunned it. Instead they have felt the need to make bold pronouncements and rush to action. That was never truer than during the season of dot-com mania, when every CEO professed to be leading a revolution. And any leader who failed to act quickly was supposed to get trampled by the capitalist vanguard. 

Now, in these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly. We're not talking about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or who sat passively in an out-of-the-way corner. Rather, they stayed with a company, steadily building influence there, and rose to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion. These qualities, of course, serve men as well as women. Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, argues that the most successful corporate turnarounds were led by such colorless men as Darwin Smith at Kimberly-Clark and William Allen at Boeing. Through a combination of deep knowledge of the corporation, personal humility, and will, they created enduring greatness. It's too early to say whether Anne Mulcahy, No. 6 on our list, can pull off such a feat. But she fits the profile. An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO, she felt ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July. ""I'm not as famous as Carly--and I want to keep it that way,"" says Mulcahy, 48. 

The famous Carly--Hewlett-Packard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorina--is still No. 1 on our list, as she has been every year since we began publishing the The Power 50 in 1998. She still heads the biggest company ($48.8 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move--a bold bet to buy competitor Compaq--but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. As a woman--and a daring, outspoken one at that--her actions are scrutinized more closely than the most driven of men. Says Fiorina: ""I've had a lot of male CEOs say to me, 'Thank God they don't rank us.' "" 

PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi (No. 10) understands the urge to take bold action, but she also knows the necessity of holding back. ""There is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a higher level--which is why women tend to push themselves harder than men,"" says Nooyi, 46. ""But we have to have the right people around who can say to us, 'You're draining the organization. You're pushing too hard.' "" Particularly now, as the U.S. prepares for an uncertain kind of war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn, power seems to call for pragmatic and careful leadership. 

This year's Power 50 is full of such steady leaders. Mulcahy, Nooyi, and the other corporate women who are new to the top ten this year--Mirant's Marce Fuller (No. 5), Pfizer's Karen Katen (No. 7), Chevron's Pat Woertz (No. 8), and Kraft's Betsy Holden (No. 9)--are all low-profile loyalists. The combined tenure at their current companies: 118 years. The six years Andrea Jung (No. 4) spent as head of marketing at Avon gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone expected when she became CEO two years ago (see It Took a Lady to Save Avon). 

As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: eBay's Meg Whitman, No. 2 on our list. Whitman, who at times took heat for not managing aggressively enough, has never overpromised investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter.

While the economy and its points of power change, the definition we use to evaluate power remains the same. We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career--where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list. She owns a product, The Oprah Winfrey Show, that generates more than $300 million in annual revenues and reaches 26 million viewers in the U.S. each week--plus millions more in 106 international markets. Her show, and now her magazine, O, The Oprah Magazine (whose subject is personal empowerment), have immense influence on the popular culture--from what books people read to what kind of lives they lead. 

The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers and three returnees from previous years. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. (Unless she wields media power like Martha Stewart, No. 13.) This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more. That's a first. The ranking has become so competitive, in fact, that some women moved down even though their power increased. Example: Shelly Lazarus. She heads a healthy business, ad giant Ogilvy & Mather (where, by the way, she has worked for 30 years), whose revenues grew 20% last year. Plus, she added a prestigious board seat--General Electric--to her resume. But in order to make room for newcomers, Lazarus slides to No. 11, from No. 7 last year. 

One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett (No. 20). Loyalty and self-knowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never imagined while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls, Vt. Barrett couldn't afford to go to a four-year college and had no specific ambition beyond believing she ""would be the best legal secretary in the world,"" she says. Barrett started as Herb Kelleher's secretary in 1967, a decade before he quit a Texas law practice to launch Southwest Airlines. She made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be America's top-performing airline. In her job as executive vice president of customers, she helped create Southwest's famously collegial culture and provided essential structure and discipline to Kelleher's grand vision. ""I've never wanted the CEO job,"" says Barrett. ""I don't think I have the talents for it. I'm a great No. 2 person."" Now 57, Barrett is exactly where she wants to be. 

Loyalty does not mean kowtowing. The women on our list push their companies to change and grow, and they take personal risks. ""Women have to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression,"" says Mirant CEO Marce Fuller. She should know. Fuller was getting great marks running international project development for Mirant's former parent, Southern, in 1994, when her boss asked her to take charge of the company's tiny North American power plant operations. After looking closely at the business, she told her boss she didn't want the job unless she could do something altogether new--build a high-tech risk-management and marketing organization to complement the expansion of power plants in the U.S. ""I told him, 'If you don't have this piece, you don't have a game plan,' "" she says. It wasn't an easy sell. Only 35 at the time, Fuller lobbied Southern's board for approval. Once she got it, she built a 600-person energy trading and marketing unit that is expected to generate $25 billion in revenues this year. Southern, a regulated utility, spun off Mirant last spring. So now Fuller is her own boss--and, with Mirant sure to be among America's largest companies this year, a FORTUNE 500 CEO. 

One of the few. The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of FORTUNE 500 companies, including Fuller. And there are fewer women in the pipeline than anyone would have thought 30 years ago. ""When I was 21, I was expecting that by this point we'd be in the fifty-fifty range,"" says Betsy Bernard (No. 23), CEO of AT&T Consumer. The reality, though disappointing, has motivated Bernard to become ""a catalyst, making sure that other women get opportunities."" Bernard, 46, and other women emerging now are not based on the old model--the shark-like Linda Wachner, whose company, Warnaco, crashed into bankruptcy this year. Or the flamboyant Jill Barad, who was booted from Mattel last year. Says PepsiCo's Indra Nooyi: ""PepsiCo, which used to be known for hiring 'Pepsi pretty'--blond, blue-eyed males--has made an Indian woman its president. That says a lot about the future of women."" Let's hope Nooyi is right. Meantime, if you don't see a new Wonder Woman in corporate America, it doesn't mean she doesn't exist. She might be quietly and diligently doing her job.

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Good suggestion.  I spoke to Scott Rebltiz who told me that important 
decisions are to made this week at OPIC concering the Gaza project.  I will 
work with Scott and John Hardy to make sure that our message is consistent 
and helpful.  I will also work with Mac for a comprehensive update and 
strategy.

Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power 
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but 
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want 
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs

566,1133,"We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

Subject: Belgium: Electricity and gas markets: recent amendments

On 24 October 2000, six Royal Decrees on the liberalisation of the energy 
(electricity and gas) market were published in the Official Gazette. Below is 
a breif summary of the decrees

Electricity matters: 

Eligibility of end users 
Elegiblility consumption threashold: 
currently 100 GWh, 20 GWh starting 31/12/00, 10 GWh starting 31/12/02 
Distribution companies are elegible, for the volume of electricity supplied 
to eligible clients within the distribution grid 
Registration requirements:
Elegible customers must provide the competent minister with all relevant 
information, such as the meter reading recording the supply of electricity 
over the previous year, and an evaluation of consumption in the next year.
For 2000,customers must register by 23/11/00, these customers will be 
elegible through 12/31/01
For all comming years, including 2001, customers must register by the 1st of 
Febuary of that year
Resistration must be renewed every year. (An official registration form is 
publish and will be available soon) 
 
Management of the transmission grid
At least half the Board of Directors must be independent directors;
The Board of Directors constitutes a governance committee composed only of 
independent directors.  This committee,s object is to:
propose candidates for appointments as independent directors; and
examine conflicts of interest between the system operator and any of its 
shareholders and report to the Board of Directors; and
rule on cases of conflicts of interest (managers and personnel); and
supervise the proper application of the Royal Decree.

The Management Board, constituted of independent members, is exclusively 
competent for the technical operation of the network.  

However, the system operator has yet to be appointed. The Council of 
Ministers may make this appointment in the next few weeks (maybe on 10 
November 2000).  The  guarantee to the right of access for the eligible 
customers, is not yet in force and shall come into force only once the 
appointment of the system operator is official.

Composition and functioning of the General Council of the CREG
The General Council of the CREG gives advice and recommendations on the 
electricity and gas market at the request of the competent Minister, a 
regional government or the executive body of the CREG.
The composition of the General Council has been amended to e.g. increase the 
representation of public authorities, and allow producers of renewable energy 
to be represented.

2.    Gas Matters
A large part of the Act of 29 April 1999 on liberalising the gas market is 
now in force.  However, most provisions now in force only empower the King or 
the competent Minister to issue (Royal) Decrees to implement the Gas Act.

Three provisions, in force since 24 October, may be singled out:

Electricity producers may buy the gas necessary to generate electricity, 
whatever their consumption.  However, the right of access to the network is 
not yet in force (same problem as for the electricity market).

Conflicts on access to the gas network may be submitted to the GREG, which 
has powers of conciliation and arbitration. An administrative court (""La 
chambre d'Appel"") will also be created to rule on this kind of conflict.  A 
Royal Decree regulating arbitration and the procedure in the administrative 
court still has to be issued.

>From the first financial year after 10 August 2000, Belgian companies that 
generate, transport, deliver, supply, stock or buy gas, must comply with 
Belgian accounting rules and keep separate books for activities of transport, 
distribution and storage of gas.

Below please find the decrees in french. Please let me know if you want them 
translated.

In July 2001 TW had a UAF gain of 93,400 dt valued at $258,718.00 which will be recorded in August business.

As expected the UAF gain was reduced after the July 10 repair to the receipt value at the Williams interconnect.  In my opinion a reserve of the $258,718 July gain is not necessary since we currently have $4.3 million already set up and the lack of recourse available to Williams.  Please indicate managements wishes.

Debbie and I have just returned from the NNG/TW UAF meeting.  On TW, a leakey receipt value was repaired on July 10, 2001 at an interconnect with Williams Field Services.  This caused unmetered gas receipts to flow into TW and there does not appear to be any way to estimated Williams losses.  Starting in August we expect the UAF gains to disappear from TW.  If so, we recommend reversal of the UAF reserves at a time management feels appropriate.   

Until then, TW has another $1 million of UAF gains which we wish to reserve.'

Subject:	Confidentiality Agreement With EonXChange

Gentlemen - 

We are working on a non-disclosure agreement with eonxchange, Inc., a software company involved in the building, licensing and operating of ""smart electronic exchanges"" through the use of ""thought-ware.""  The basis for the NDA is the disclosure between the companies of software products and ideas (associated with the EOL software) and discussions concerning a possible transaction involving either the purchase or long term license of some aspects of the products eonxchange owns.  This possible transaction is in association with an ongoing project by ENW involving the EOL software.

The original NDA provided was provided to ENW through a financial advisor to eonxchange (Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin Capital) and contained a unilateral non-solicitation provision in favor of eonxchange.  We have responded a bilateral provision consistent with our standard non-solicitation provision.  I have attempted to further limit this language so that it would only be applicable between eonxchange and ENW (and not affiliates/subsidiary and parent companies).  This was, however, rejected by eonxchange.

I have attached the most current provision below for your review, comment and/or approval.  At your convenience, please let me know if the attached is acceptable for the eonxchange non-disclosure agreement.

If any of you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

Interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by Tim - 
says a lot about the way MG do business I think.

RE NY we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( Philip 
Bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a DASH for each prepayment on a 
contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in NY and we may have 
some issues - although Marcelo and others stressed the fact that Concentrates 
appeared to move no product without a letter of credit, which was then often 
discounted to realise cash!!

Shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment 
yesterday from Philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were 
'unique' - whilst I can accept that each may be tailored to customer 
preferences - they still need to be CACSed - we should look at the 
enforceability/legal risk here.

Whilst information prepayment risk for Metals should come from London - 
accessing any relevent inofrmation from NY may be helpful

Will call later !

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

The situation at present is as follows:

MG have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper 
from the Russian Federation on a prepayment basis

all contracts are on a floating price basis (LME less discount)

notional value of each contract is circa $0.5-3mm

prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis, for between 90-95% value 
with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents

The issues break down into three broad areas:

1) Commercial

At present Enron does not engage in prepayment activities with Russian 
Federation counterparties.

No further prepayments are permitted until RAC have performed a DASH for this 
activity. As this is likely to take several weeks Howard will liase with 
Commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising 
from this suspension. Howard and David Hardy will also take immediate steps 
to manage down existing prepayment exposures.

2) Legal

Based on a cursory review of the confirmations by Robert, if we are to 
continue this activity Legal need to instructed to perform a full review for 
several reasons, including:

the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms, 
e.g. pricing date

they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments, and are generally not 
constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity.

""Conditions of Purchase"" are attached to the confirmations which refer to 
English Law, but as they are not always countersigned, under conflict rules 
the closest or real connection may be deemed to be Russian law which, in the 
absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability.

there are several ""open"" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are 
beyond the delivery period, and which could be considered to have been 
discharged by breach. Again the confirmation does not contain adequate 
language.

3) Credit/Operational

There are no formal counterparty limits. Nor are prepayment and volumetric 
exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis. This information is 
necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance, and needs to be 
factored into the overall credit monitoring process.

David has requested this information from MG, and will follow up this one off 
exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track 
exposures based on the methodology developed for Helsinki.


Further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that, 
despite the issues identified with contractual terms, there is performance 
against the contracts. David is pursuing this from a Credit perspective and 
will report back to his group his findings by Friday latest.

The issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to 
accelerate a planned review of contract language for all MG's activities in 
all jurisdictions. Mike and I will discuss bringing this review forward with 
Justin.

Any questions, please call.

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS: NO SECURITIZATION PLAN OR BAILOUT SEEN
Leading California state legislators said Tuesday that they are looking at 
several proposals to secure future electricity supplies, but they have no 
intention of taking responsibility for the nearly $12 billion in power costs 
the state's investor-owned utilities have failed to collect since May.

CONNECTICUT REGULATORS TO APPROVE MILLSTONE SALE TO DOMINION

reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the 
need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in 
writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an 
efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define 
and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, 
then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On 
the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully 
understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an Enron 
publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if 
so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an 
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

Hey Everybody,

Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine and copy both
sides of each license, credit card, etc. You will know what you had in
your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and
cancel in case it gets lost or worse yet, stolen. Keep the photocopy in
a safe place.

I pass this along, for your information, in case you hadn't thought of
it. We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed us in
your name, address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately (the author of this
piece who happens to be an attorney) had firsthand knowledge, because
my wallet was stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered
an expensive monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,
had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN
number from DMV to change my driving record information online, and
more.

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free
numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those

where you can find the easily. File a police report immediately in the
jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you
were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there
ever is one).

But here's what is perhaps most important:  (I never ever thought to do
this).  Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.  I had never
heard of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was
stolen and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By

the time I was advised to do this almost 2 weeks after the theft, all
the damage had been done. There are records of all the credit checks
initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about before
placing the alert. Since then, no additional damage has been done, and
the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It
seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

The numbers are:
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271

Do think about passing this information along. It could really help
someone.",False

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in 
doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.  I feel like it's been a 
while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed 
the interaction.  It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the 
worlds problems over cold Shiner and I think the world may be the worse for 
it.  So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of 
eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.  If it looks like 'a go', 
I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.

The one and only,

Tribune Co. reported a net loss of $139 million for 3Q01, citing an advertising falloff, an expensive restructuring, and costs of news coverage in the wake of the September attacks.  The Chicago-based company, which owns 11 newspapers, 22 television stations, and more than 50 Web sites, had cut 6% to 7% of its work force because of the advertising slump. The attacks increased spending in the form of extra newspaper editions, extended coverage by its TV and radio stations, and increased capacity by its Web sites.  Revenue from publishing -- largely newspapers -- declined 8%  and retail advertising was down 7%.  For the first 9 months, the company had a net loss of $15.7 million, compared with year-earlier earnings of $168 million.  The trend continues as major media companies report their 3Q01 results...
Stay tuned for the market wrap this afternoon.

675,2770,"Cory Gordon concluded his examination on Friday.? Highlights: 

--The NSM/Pruessag Off-Take Agreements did not contain any tonnage and/or 
quality requirements. 

--Part of the offering proceeds ($3 million) were mysteriously paid to an 
entity called Rowlyn Investments.? The disbursement was approved by Shultes.? 
Nolan had no knowledge of the payment or the entity.

--NSM purchased its scrap from Suntech -- a company not surprisingly 
controlled by Swasdi. 

--Nolan learned of SDI's termination after the letter had been sent by 
Busse.? Nolan was surprised and shocked to see the letter.? Nolan believes 
that the plant can be salvaged and will ""make a lot of money for someone"" in 
the future.

Swartz began his examination late afternoon and tried to get Nolan focused on 
the two days prior to the Oct. 13 Bondholders' meeting.? Swartz asked Nolan 
about the source of the cash flow numbers presented to the bondholders.? 
Nolan generally deferred all questions concerning the cash/expenditure 
numbers to Stickler and Heasley.? Swartz did not ask questions about 
ECT/Enron although he did inquire whether Kevin McConville was generally 
accessible to Nolan.? Nolan stated that while he worked more closely with 
Stickler, Ari Levy and Heasly, McConville was responsive.

Michael Tomaino was the only defense counsel to ask questions.? Tomaino 
focused on the problems SDI had with its start up phase and the depressed 
nature of the East Asian steel market in 1998.? Nolan stated that the 
operational and quality problems NSM faced were identical to those faced by 
SDI during its start up.? Nolan also stated that, in his opinion, the 
depressed Asian market was to blame for NSM's demise.?

We need to find a better way around this no-one is ever going to consent if 
that is required for specific customers.  But on the major point , having 
spoken to Bryan over th elast couple of days, I believe he is not going to 
quote on any entity we have a big relationship with initially.  I have seen 
the first pass at the list but know that Bryan wasn't happy with it as it 
included people like TXU.

On the other point do you actually mean consent or notification - if we send 
them a notice, follow up with  a phone call on the big ones then we can make 
a business decision about how they feel.  Do they actually need to agree on 
paper?

Subject: Re: Consent  

Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after 
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference 
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were 
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was 
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities 
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each 
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or 
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing 
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of 
these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been 
reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by 
no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet 
determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business 
relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require 
significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to 
make important judgment calls.

My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice 
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved 
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on 
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we 
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those 
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them 
as a Reference Entity.

We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the 
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference 
Entities as soon as possible.

Subject: Consent

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference 
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at 
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions 
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference 
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial 
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits 
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we 
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be 
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that 
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small 
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies 
for the miscommunication.

Call me if you want to discuss further.

701,1045,"Chris,

I got a call this morning from Bill Geist from Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  He is interested in ENA's agency, transport, storage and fuel management agreements.  I told him that we may be looking for a buyer of our Bridgeline inventory.  He was interested.  Call him at 402-758-6195.  He may also be interested in picking up the contracts also.

In the past the following folks have also expressed an interest in storage/inventory in the Gulf Coast.  The numbers are on our contact list.

Cook Inlet
Cinergy
CMS Energy Trading
Dominion
Marathon
Oneok
Sempra
Western Gas Resources
TXU

Be sure to ask them if there is any interest in picking up the storage contract and firm transport agreements.  I would tell them that both are discounted from the maximum tariff rates.

703,1489,"Stan, the Bushton Team met yesterday and decided that there is no value and substantial risk to Northern in accepting OneOk's suggestion that we rewrite the Bushton Measurement Agreement to operate like the OneOk-Kinder Morgan Scott City measurement agreement.  We are reluctant to incorporate the PTR formula in any way beyond the limited purpose it serves under the current Measurement Agreement.  The following are talking points that Dave Neubauer will use today in a conversation with Terry Spencer, who is Steve Winston's boss.  Since Winston's proposal (which I sent to you by email last week) was a draft and has never been formally sent to us, we decided that having Dave deliver our message to Terry made more sense than sending a letter or elevating the issue to your and John Gibson's level.  However, if Gibson calls you and raises the issue of their proposal, the following points contain our message.  

	Spencer may agree in the call with Dave to reconcile the April and May imbalance based on our metered numbers.  If not, Britt has prepared a demand letter that can be sent at any time to get resolution of that issue rolling.  I believe that Gibson indicated that he'd be calling you back this week to talk about this matter, so your conversation should take place before we send the demand letter. I'll forward the demand letter for your review separately. 
 		
	On the other proposal from OneOk that I forwarded to you last week (relating to operational changes designed to allow OneOk to get the helium plant running again), we have made some minor modifications and are sending the counterproposal back to OneOk.  We expect to get that deal in place with them soon.  This is a good development for them, and with little or no risk to us, and should temper any disappointment they feel because of our rejection of their measurment proposal.   

	Please give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks. DF



 

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a ""BTU measurement error"" (i.e., when the chromatograph malfunctions).   

2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the Oneok meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration. 

3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a ""special test"" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.

4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.

5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.",False
